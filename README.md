# ClosedCaptions

This repository contains all closed caption / transcription files for my videos on YouTube.  It's my goal to have all of my videos captioned as well as translated into foreign languages.

I am in the process of looking into some paid services to caption my videos.  In the meantime I am also experimenting with community contributed captions.  If you would like to help, you can try contributing on [Amara](http://amara.org/) as well as YouTube directly.

1. Caption my videos on Amara: http://www.amara.org/en/profiles/videos/shiffman/
2. Contribute directly on YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/timedtext_cs_panel?tab=2&c=UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw
