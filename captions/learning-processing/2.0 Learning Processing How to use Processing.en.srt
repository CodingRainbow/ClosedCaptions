1
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:07,294
Hi, you came back, it's very kind of you

2
00:00:07,294 --> 00:00:09,588
So, we're ready now to take a
look at Processing itself

3
00:00:09,588 --> 00:00:12,496
and see if we can take some of this
knowledge and apply it

4
00:00:12,496 --> 00:00:19,578
in Processing itself, write some code,
draw some pictures to the screen

5
00:00:19,608 --> 00:00:24,014
This is what I want this video to really cover,
to get you comfortable to make sure

6
00:00:24,014 --> 00:00:27,313
not only to have the basic understanding of
the coordinate system

7
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,119
and how to write some functions that
will draw to that

8
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:36,010
that to a window, but also how
the Processing software environment

9
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:37,007
actually works as well

10
00:00:37,007 --> 00:00:41,066
So, if we walk over here, this is the
Processing website

11
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:45,020
Processing.org
I will include a link, of course, below

12
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:48,564
to this site, this is where
you can click here to download Processing

13
00:00:48,564 --> 00:00:51,413
Processing is an application just
like anything else

14
00:00:51,413 --> 00:00:57,260
you can download it, install it, and run it,
i'm not gonna go through those steps right now in this video

15
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:00,078
The only piece of information that I'm assuming

16
00:01:00,078 --> 00:01:03,122
knowledge of which is that, just a knowledge of

17
00:01:03,122 --> 00:01:05,179
how to install software on your computer

18
00:01:05,179 --> 00:01:10,072
So what, you know, if I forgot something,
you know, call, write, and send your complete

19
00:01:10,072 --> 00:01:12,026
letters to me

20
00:01:12,026 --> 00:01:15,077
Ok, so once you've downloaded
and installed Processing and run it

21
00:01:15,077 --> 00:01:18,829
you're going to get a nice little
window like this

22
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:23,068
So, Processing is, it's many things
in a way it's a programming language

23
00:01:23,068 --> 00:01:27,127
The truth of the matter is that programming
language writing in which we talk about

24
00:01:27,127 --> 00:01:29,568
is the Java programming language

25
00:01:29,568 --> 00:01:32,547
But Processing has a whole set of functions

26
00:01:32,547 --> 00:01:34,640
and things that have been added

27
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,933
that are going to live to serve
easily draw to the screen as well as

28
00:01:36,933 --> 00:01:40,885
it stripped away some of the obnoxious

29
00:01:40,885 --> 00:01:42,181
You know, I don't like to insult Java

30
00:01:42,181 --> 00:01:46,481
I actually realy love Java even though that makes me
just about the least cool person in the world

31
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:51,156
But it's taking away a lot of the
stuff that makes it uncomfortable to

32
00:01:51,156 --> 00:01:53,068
begin with Java and make things simpler

33
00:01:53,068 --> 00:01:56,607
So it is a programming language,
realy the language you writing is Java

34
00:01:57,219 --> 00:01:58,579
it's certainly an environment

35
00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:02,990
this is the environment that you're
going to type in "Hello, I love Processing!"

36
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:06,056
This could theoretically be a Processing
program, if we read it

37
00:02:06,056 --> 00:02:09,292
we're gonna get some sort of errors like
I have no idea what that means

38
00:02:09,292 --> 00:02:14,225
But it's an environment, this is the place
where you can type your code and execute your code

39
00:02:14,225 --> 00:02:16,053
which is one of the wonderful
things about Processing

40
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:19,499
because you don't have to figure out which
text editor should I using and how do I compile

41
00:02:19,499 --> 00:02:22,227
and where I should go to view it
and where I debug it

42
00:02:22,227 --> 00:02:26,124
everything is here in Processing itself

43
00:02:26,124 --> 00:02:29,031
The other thing is really it's a community
So we go back to this website

44
00:02:29,031 --> 00:02:32,434
there are examples, there's a forum, there's

45
00:02:32,461 --> 00:02:37,333
It's open source, there is a rich
community of people, there is a lots of

46
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:40,057
other sites that I could link to how
to a using Processing, sharing code

47
00:02:40,057 --> 00:02:43,861
teaching with Processing,
making project with Processing

48
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:48,759
So, in addition to just being software there's also
this vibrant community which will hopefully

49
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:52,363
help you feel happier and more comfortable
kind of diving into this new world

50
00:02:52,363 --> 00:02:54,496
of programming for the first time

51
00:02:54,996 --> 00:02:58,008
Ok, so once you've downloaded Processing

52
00:02:58,008 --> 00:03:01,019
you've run it, you've got this window

53
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:04,996
So, a couple things I should point out
there is up here, right?

54
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:15,620
This triangle is the Run button

55
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:18,015
It looks kind of like the play button on some

56
00:03:18,015 --> 00:03:21,039
media device, like I don't know, a VCR

57
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:25,594
an Apple TV, Apple TV or Roku boxes play buttons

58
00:03:25,594 --> 00:03:29,636
but anyway the point is this is your Run button

59
00:03:29,636 --> 00:03:31,473
but it is not really Play

60
00:03:31,473 --> 00:03:36,012
Run means is compile your code,
compile your code and execute it

61
00:03:36,012 --> 00:03:39,245
So it's going to run through your code,
compile it to binary

62
00:03:39,245 --> 00:03:42,082
execute and run the program which is why

63
00:03:42,082 --> 00:03:45,983
when we ran this one we got this error

64
00:03:45,983 --> 00:03:50,094
It said "Unexpected token: Hello"
Now, one of the things I like about Processing is

65
00:03:50,094 --> 00:03:53,132
it sometimes gives you a nice friendly error message

66
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:55,085
and sometimes it doesn't but

67
00:03:55,085 --> 00:03:58,089
we can just... I didn't mean to talk
about is now but

68
00:03:58,089 --> 00:04:01,041
whenever you have a mistake in your
syntax you're going to get an error

69
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:05,011
and that error will hopefully lead you to
how to fix that, the your syntax

70
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:08,044
But here we say (?) it says
"Unexpected token: Hello"

71
00:04:08,044 --> 00:04:13,025
because Hello is not token meaning a some
sequence of characters in-between spaces

72
00:04:13,025 --> 00:04:16,356
and punctuation, a word, so to speak

73
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:19,877
It unexpected because it doesn't know
what Hello means

74
00:04:19,877 --> 00:04:24,133
Perhaps, it would know what line is

75
00:04:24,133 --> 00:04:30,077
So, for example, if instead of writing that, I wrote
line and what did we say

76
00:04:30,077 --> 00:04:35,033
a 100, 50, 600, 250 and I put a semicolon

77
00:04:35,033 --> 00:04:39,041
and I run this program, we would see

78
00:04:41,013 --> 00:04:42,044
I'm not over here!

79
00:04:42,044 --> 00:04:47,462
Hey! I apologize. This is a.. I can't go back and fix it

80
00:04:47,462 --> 00:04:50,033
It just gonna have to.. someday I'll fix this video

81
00:04:50,033 --> 00:04:54,031
I'll have the way like (?) and I'll just
I (?) record all these cause I just

82
00:04:54,031 --> 00:04:57,535
you know, this is like (?) really for that video

83
00:04:57,535 --> 00:05:00,075
that I imagine would be so perfect, but you can see

84
00:05:00,075 --> 00:05:02,278
I was able to run this program and there was no error

85
00:05:02,278 --> 00:05:06,889
So, this is a fine syntax, it's a syntax
actually we will learn

86
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:11,894
How to draw a line from point X
from the first XY to the second XY

87
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:14,014
Now, the window we got here

88
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:16,514
doesn't actually have the line and it's also very small

89
00:05:16,514 --> 00:05:20,022
Didn't we say that a window should be 645 by 360?

90
00:05:20,022 --> 00:05:23,063
Well, one of the things that we haven't learned

91
00:05:23,063 --> 00:05:26,110
is actualy how to set a size of the window

92
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:29,007
We can see that by default if you don't specify a size

93
00:05:29,016 --> 00:05:31,909
we are actualy getting on 100 by 100 pixel wide window

94
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:34,710
So, here we now about to learn another function

95
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:41,021
Size. s i z e and I can say 640, 360, semicolon

96
00:05:41,021 --> 00:05:43,100
And now we have, look at this, two lines of code!

97
00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:47,789
Really got a program now. Size, line.
And if we run this one which I can also do

98
00:05:47,789 --> 00:05:49,027
cmd+R option do, and we see

99
00:05:49,027 --> 00:05:53,080
There it is! There's that program!
I sadly erase the drawing on the board

100
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:57,139
We could see that it basically mirrors exactly
what we draw on the board

101
00:05:57,139 --> 00:05:58,719
So now is the moment

102
00:05:58,719 --> 00:06:01,757
when you could say to yourself
"This drawing that I made with

103
00:06:02,099 --> 00:06:06,005
pencil and paper, let me see if I can
recreate it in Processing?""

104
00:06:06,005 --> 00:06:11,074
"Can I write the instructions to create that drawing?"
And this is your first practice in programming

105
00:06:11,074 --> 00:06:13,899
I should point out that even though these were

106
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:17,279
I said we weren't in the introduction anymore,
cause we actually making staff and using Processing

107
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:18,889
We're still in the introduction

108
00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:21,932
We're not really programming, well, we are programming

109
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,333
We are writing code

110
00:06:23,459 --> 00:06:27,237
We are compiling an executing that code,
but there's no real logic here

111
00:06:27,237 --> 00:06:31,836
We're not saying "Hey, you know, if this
happens then do this"

112
00:06:31,836 --> 00:06:33,800
we're not creating this kind of flow

113
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,729
this complex sequence of logic,
we just kind of issuing almost

114
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:39,751
a linear list of commands that ends
with a static picture

115
00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:43,599
So, really what we want to get to in the next
set of videos is that

116
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:47,539
flow the program that large,
we're gonna really do so much more

117
00:06:47,539 --> 00:06:51,570
to start understanding the foundation's
of computational thinking

118
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:54,037
Right now we're just kind of practicing
by getting used to

119
00:06:54,037 --> 00:06:56,036
syntax and the Run button

120
00:06:56,036 --> 00:07:01,041
and I hope the camera might cut-up the second

121
00:07:01,086 --> 00:07:03,133
Excuse me for a second I coming right back

122
00:07:04,033 --> 00:07:07,076
Hello, i just had to press the button at
the end part of the room

123
00:07:07,076 --> 00:07:11,028
Ok, so, now this brings us to my next point

124
00:07:11,028 --> 00:07:16,095
So, let's say that what we want to do

125
00:07:16,095 --> 00:07:17,184
I knew that will happen

126
00:07:18,084 --> 00:07:22,985
Let's.. Hi... Ok, I have to press another button,
this is terrible, I really should edit this

127
00:07:22,985 --> 00:07:27,014
somehow and some there will, you could, if
someone download this video,

128
00:07:27,014 --> 00:07:31,063
cut-up some parts and then send it to me,
I'll reupload it

129
00:07:31,063 --> 00:07:35,919
But, listen, so, so, let's look at this list over here

130
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,034
These are the list of functions
we are going to start with

131
00:07:39,034 --> 00:07:43,033
Rectangle, ellipse, line, and point.
And this is our window

132
00:07:43,033 --> 00:07:46,814
which is 640 by 360 and, let's say, we want

133
00:07:46,814 --> 00:07:50,075
to kind of draw this.. I don't know what i'm doing..

134
00:07:50,075 --> 00:07:54,897
Something like this.. This could be
our (?), but

135
00:07:54,897 --> 00:07:57,197
You guys are hopefully much more artistic than me

136
00:07:57,197 --> 00:07:59,268
and can came up with something more creative

137
00:07:59,268 --> 00:08:04,130
But all we know is how to draw a line,
now we need to discover how to draw a rectangle

138
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:10,015
So, you could guess, we could.. I wish we have a little
dialogue here "Hey, whether you've some ideas,

139
00:08:10,015 --> 00:08:13,041
you know, how would you design the rectangle
function for Processing,

140
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:15,029
what arguments would you require?"

141
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:17,887
and you might say "Oh, what about the XY of this
point and the XY of this point,

142
00:08:17,887 --> 00:08:23,022
that's a possibility, what about the XY of the center
and the width and the height,

143
00:08:23,022 --> 00:08:25,322
what about the XY of the corner and a width and height?"

144
00:08:25,322 --> 00:08:28,049
In fact, all of this is are possible,

145
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:32,042
but the default way of drawing
a rectangle in Processing is

146
00:08:32,042 --> 00:08:34,876
with four arguments

147
00:08:34,876 --> 00:08:36,677
So, rectangle has four arguments:

148
00:08:36,677 --> 00:08:42,847
x, y, width and height,
the x and y being the location of the top left

149
00:08:42,847 --> 00:08:46,351
the width being the width in pixels

150
00:08:46,351 --> 00:08:50,013
and the h, the height, the h being the height in pixels

151
00:08:50,013 --> 00:08:53,014
So let's go add this to our program over here,

152
00:08:53,023 --> 00:08:58,002
Let's say, okay, we want to draw a rectangle
and just to sort to see that it's working

153
00:08:58,002 --> 00:09:01,039
let's make the XY the same as the top left corner

154
00:09:01,057 --> 00:09:02,006
of this line

155
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:07,075
and let's make a very a skinny rectangle, it's
only 20 pixels, but rather tall

156
00:09:07,075 --> 00:09:11,742
That's 200 pixel and if we run this,
we can see, look,

157
00:09:11,742 --> 00:09:14,891
we now have a rectangle with (?)
this kind of slide thing,

158
00:09:14,891 --> 00:09:18,036
we have this line and we have a rectangle
over here with the XY,

159
00:09:18,036 --> 00:09:22,043
and I could zoom all the way into this,
not sure of point of that,

160
00:09:22,043 --> 00:09:25,047
but the XY being the top left, the width
being 20 pixels

161
00:09:25,047 --> 00:09:29,757
and a height being whatever I typed, 200 and
something like that, 200 pixels

162
00:09:29,757 --> 00:09:33,279
Okay, so we can see.. Ah, okay, now we learned

163
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,921
how to draw a rectangle! And I could go
through and show you ellpise and line and point

164
00:09:36,921 --> 00:09:38,990
There are a lots of other drawing functions
in Processing

165
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:41,808
But, I mean, what I'm not going to sit here all day

166
00:09:41,808 --> 00:09:43,579
and talk through everything, all possible way

167
00:09:43,579 --> 00:09:46,082
to draw everything in Processing

168
00:09:46,882 --> 00:09:50,591
There's gotta be a better way, right?
It doesn't just happen and you should..

169
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,825
There is some interesing, a lots of
interesting ideas and

170
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:55,889
how make this more intuitive, why are we
actually doing the programming itself

171
00:09:55,889 --> 00:09:57,700
I mean, what if instead of typing this out,

172
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,029
you could just draw a rectangle on the screen

173
00:09:59,074 --> 00:10:03,049
and code woulds only up here, but that's not really
the point what we're doing here

174
00:10:03,049 --> 00:10:06,648
What I want to say is what one of the things
you want to get used to is

175
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:08,389
how you look up this information

176
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:10,882
How do you look up how to
draw a line if you didn't know

177
00:10:10,882 --> 00:10:13,017
if you weren't just

178
00:10:13,017 --> 00:10:15,042
if you didn't just enjoy watching videos
of somebody

179
00:10:15,042 --> 00:10:19,211
with kinda slightly messy hair and just
talks and talks and talks all the time

180
00:10:19,589 --> 00:10:22,051
So, the way you do that

181
00:10:22,051 --> 00:10:25,370
is through the Processing website which
through the reference

182
00:10:25,829 --> 00:10:29,066
So over here there was a link to
reference and it left over here

183
00:10:29,066 --> 00:10:34,367
and if I click on a reference, we gonna
suddenly see this webpage has a list

184
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,138
of all these possible functions and
these are the ones

185
00:10:37,138 --> 00:10:39,006
I want us to kinda lookat right now

186
00:10:39,006 --> 00:10:42,891
2D primitives: arc, ellipse, line, point
quad, rect, triangle

187
00:10:42,891 --> 00:10:45,949
Here's a list of basic drawing functions
in Processing

188
00:10:45,949 --> 00:10:49,025
each one of those is a link, if you go to
that link, it's going to show you

189
00:10:49,709 --> 00:10:52,715
"Hey, here's the syntax, here's the name
of the function

190
00:10:52,769 --> 00:10:56,047
here are the arguments, here are what the
arguments do, here is an example"

191
00:10:56,047 --> 00:11:01,576
So just... Let's go to rectangle which I
think is a good one to look at

192
00:11:01,576 --> 00:11:05,329
We can see "Hey, look, here's
the name of the function rect

193
00:11:05,329 --> 00:11:08,660
and here's an example of what it looks like,
four numbers"

194
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:12,339
I don't know what those numbers are,
by the way you can do

195
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:17,249
Rounded rectangles and slightly (?).
And you can read the description

196
00:11:17,249 --> 00:11:21,169
But really, and you can see here, this is
what we're doing

197
00:11:21,169 --> 00:11:24,175
We're making a rectangle with a, b, c, d

198
00:11:24,175 --> 00:11:27,771
Now, I often think of those I did on
the board of there's X

199
00:11:27,789 --> 00:11:34,459
X, Y, W, H, because X for x, Y for y
W for width, H for height

200
00:11:34,459 --> 00:11:37,022
But we can see here in the reference

201
00:11:37,022 --> 00:11:40,009
It's going to describe that for us
and I'mgoing to

202
00:11:40,009 --> 00:11:43,033
zoom out slightly, oh, not all the way

203
00:11:43,249 --> 00:11:46,799
We can sort of see here and we'll try to get
this in a way that you can see it

204
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:49,801
We can see here rectangle ABCD, A is the

205
00:11:49,999 --> 00:11:54,012
x-coord the rectangle by default, B is
the y-coordinge of the rectangle

206
00:11:54,129 --> 00:11:57,136
C is the width and D is the height

207
00:11:57,199 --> 00:12:00,959
So, we can see, that this page is giving us

208
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,360
what the syntax is, what those arguments are

209
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,559
what the argument actually do

210
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:08,608
and then at the top here a few examples and
I'm not gonna go through

211
00:12:08,608 --> 00:12:10,063
how the rounded staff works

212
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:14,022
This is on you can explore on your own and ask
questions in my new weekly

213
00:12:14,022 --> 00:12:17,971
program "Ask a Processing question" which
will start sometime in September

214
00:12:18,169 --> 00:12:22,072
I don't know, I don't like plugging the video
within video for no reason, I admit that to be

215
00:12:22,072 --> 00:12:27,739
strange and humorous and it was not, I laughed
sadly inside by myself

216
00:12:27,739 --> 00:12:30,765
Okay, so this is really where we are

217
00:12:30,999 --> 00:12:34,129
I think I'm actually kind of coming to the end

218
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:38,720
of this video, now, what you can do
for your exercise is

219
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,035
In the next video we will look at color

220
00:12:41,035 --> 00:12:49,189
What you can do for your exercise is go
through the reference pages for ellipse,

221
00:12:49,209 --> 00:12:51,243
and design your drawing

222
00:12:51,243 --> 00:12:54,003
Now, show you, I often suggest to make a little

223
00:12:54,003 --> 00:12:56,899
alien or monster, it's kind of a nice thing
to start with

224
00:12:56,899 --> 00:12:59,015
Really any pattern that you might want to think today

225
00:12:59,015 --> 00:13:03,097
See if you can create it with numbers. And
again let me just point something out

226
00:13:03,097 --> 00:13:08,073
This is kind of a silly exercise, it's almost like
(?)

227
00:13:08,073 --> 00:13:09,550
It's kind of a diversion

228
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:14,375
Programming is not about hardcoding numbers
into functions to create a picture

229
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:18,042
Programming is about creating a sequence of instructions

230
00:13:18,042 --> 00:13:21,048
a logic to execute a task

231
00:13:21,048 --> 00:13:26,823
But just to get started, and really
we want to avoid, we want to really

232
00:13:26,823 --> 00:13:29,906
Hello over here, we want to avoid

233
00:13:29,906 --> 00:13:34,672
This way, this type of co... (?)
we want to avoid this

234
00:13:34,672 --> 00:13:40,989
We don't want to have a lot of all these hardcoded
numbers and this this is not is not

235
00:13:40,989 --> 00:13:43,263
It will all become clear as we move on

236
00:13:43,263 --> 00:13:46,087
But this is not what we're doing
eventually, but it's a good

237
00:13:46,087 --> 00:13:51,016
place to get kind of started and this
kind get used to the Processing

238
00:13:51,016 --> 00:13:53,068
and get used to what errors you gonna get

239
00:13:53,068 --> 00:13:56,161
like when I forget that semicolon again

240
00:13:57,061 --> 00:14:00,081
Let me forget this semicolon instead
Yes, I guess

241
00:14:00,081 --> 00:14:04,863
this is without one at the bottom here it said

242
00:14:04,863 --> 00:14:07,068
"Syntax error; maybe a missing semicolon?"

243
00:14:07,068 --> 00:14:09,034
So you can see you want to just get through practice

244
00:14:09,034 --> 00:14:13,505
what kind of syntax errors are you gonna make
or you used to fixing them, can you look up

245
00:14:13,505 --> 00:14:15,856
staff in the reference, can you make that

246
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:17,049
that picture with Processing

247
00:14:17,049 --> 00:14:21,703
So, work on that, the next video will go over
how to add color to this as well as

248
00:14:21,703 --> 00:14:24,209
kind of filling some of the blanks with some
of this functions

249
00:14:24,209 --> 00:14:29,011
I will be kind of wrapping up this sort of first
group of videos about just kind of

250
00:14:29,011 --> 00:14:32,020
the basics of syntax and the basics of drawing
in Processing

251
00:14:33,001 --> 00:14:36,097
Great! Thank you, I'm going to press this button
