00:00:05,234 --> 00:00:09,117
Hello!

2
00:00:09,117 --> 00:00:10,679
Aaaawk, so awkward

3
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:13,679
because it's very hard to begin these things but we're just gonna go right in

4
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,054
and we're going to begin

5
00:00:15,054 --> 00:00:19,522
Hello my name is Dan. Perhaps you watched a video that I’ve been in before or perhaps you haven’t

6
00:00:19,522 --> 00:00:23,011
I don't know how you got here but you're here, I'm here, you're here,

7
00:00:23,011 --> 00:00:26,667
we're here together, there's a wall here, I can write on it

8
00:00:26,667 --> 00:00:29,391
there’s gonna be a computer over there. why are we here?

9
00:00:29,391 --> 00:00:35,689
Have you ever wanted to learn programming? have you never even tried to learn programming?

10
00:00:35,689 --> 00:00:37,209
have you never written a line of code

11
00:00:37,217 --> 00:00:39,416
before in your life? you have no idea what it means

12
00:00:39,416 --> 00:00:43,001
to program to write code to create your own software?

13
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:45,678
do you want to break free from the bonds

14
00:00:45,678 --> 00:00:49,408
of the tools that other people have made for you?

15
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:51,759
do you want to write your own, to build your own software?

16
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:53,633
make your own things from scratch

17
00:00:53,633 --> 00:00:55,718
on the computer? If so …

18
00:00:55,718 --> 00:01:00,154
this sounds like a sales pitch but really there's nothing to sell here, you could just leave

19
00:01:00,154 --> 00:01:01,302
at any moment

20
00:01:01,302 --> 00:01:05,465
but if so you're in the right place! this is a video series

21
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:08,269
that is going to teach you how to program

22
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:14,085
your computer. now how, what kind of, what programming language you use,

23
00:01:14,105 --> 00:01:14,891
what environment you use,

24
00:01:14,891 --> 00:01:17,841
what it is you want to make, is a huge giant

25
00:01:17,841 --> 00:01:22,380
mess of stuff. we're gonna do things in a simple way,

26
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,431
I’m gonna talk a lot more about this something called Processing, I'm just going to talk

27
00:01:26,431 --> 00:01:27,328
to you

28
00:01:27,328 --> 00:01:30,024
going to draw diagrams, I will demonstrate for you

29
00:01:30,024 --> 00:01:33,756
code examples on this computer over here

30
00:01:33,756 --> 00:01:36,984
it's all going to be in video. now

31
00:01:36,984 --> 00:01:41,244
you might have some questions like: oh, I get it, I heard about these things

32
00:01:41,244 --> 00:01:45,838
kinda like a MOOC, I don't know how to pronounce it, is this a MOOC?

33
00:01:45,838 --> 00:01:49,858
it's not a MOOC, could be a MOOC, you could make it a MOOC

34
00:01:49,858 --> 00:01:53,262
but MOOCs are a little bit scary. this is just some videos

35
00:01:53,262 --> 00:01:57,182
to help you learn. I hope you might find, you might do this on your own

36
00:01:57,182 --> 00:02:00,669
you might use these in the conference, to supplement a class you're taking

37
00:02:00,669 --> 00:02:04,428
you might be a teacher of some other people and want to use these videos in

38
00:02:04,428 --> 00:02:05,305
your course

39
00:02:05,305 --> 00:02:09,625
I don't know but I would like them to be helpful however you think

40
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:13,521
they might be helpful! so the other thing you might ask is

41
00:02:13,521 --> 00:02:17,968
this seems a little weird just talking and drawing diagrams. you know I hear about all these

42
00:02:17,968 --> 00:02:20,373
new fancy interactive online learning

43
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:23,730
test quizzing and I can … You know that those things are great

44
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,666
and I would like to ultimately incorporate

45
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:30,425
some stuff where you could easily look at the code while I'm

46
00:02:30,425 --> 00:02:35,041
demonstrating it, trying things out. the Khan Academy is doing some fantastic stuff

47
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:36,153
John Resig and

48
00:02:36,153 --> 00:02:39,643
the CS courses, I highly recommend them, they’re doing a lot of similar stuff

49
00:02:39,643 --> 00:02:43,372
I'm just kinda doing what I know which is drawing to a whiteboard

50
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:47,453
and using this computing machine

51
00:02:47,453 --> 00:02:51,079
to type out examples. they will all be available for you to download

52
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:55,943
there's even a book that I will hesitate to show you that you could use to follow

53
00:02:55,943 --> 00:02:56,568
along

54
00:02:56,568 --> 00:02:59,067
I'm also going to do some live

55
00:02:59,067 --> 00:03:03,088
online live events where I am

56
00:03:03,088 --> 00:03:06,933
gonna take calls and answers questions which is another …

57
00:03:06,933 --> 00:03:09,441
I kinda digress here but that's gonna happen too so

58
00:03:09,441 --> 00:03:13,161
that's really, I made some notes over here and I

59
00:03:13,161 --> 00:03:16,212
this is a so far I’ve only been talking for three minutes, this is my intro video

60
00:03:16,212 --> 00:03:21,035
but so if you really just want to get into the meat of the stuff you can skip ahead

61
00:03:24,826 --> 00:03:25,472
cause I haven't made it yet

62
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:24,826
I don't know, I will link to it, I don't know the video number yet

63
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:28,293
but there's a video you can just jump to which is hey

64
00:03:28,293 --> 00:03:31,679
let's start, let’s write our first line of code, let's see how everything works

65
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:35,897
but I'm going to have a few more videos just kinda talk

66
00:03:35,897 --> 00:03:38,136
a little more about who I am, what I imagine you might use this for,

67
00:03:38,136 --> 00:03:41,304
what is programming in perhaps a kind of general question, what our programming

68
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:45,509
languages is, what you might use that I'm using, why am I using this one versus that one

69
00:03:45,532 --> 00:03:48,887
wooo … everything's gonna be okay, I think so

70
00:03:48,887 --> 00:03:52,780
so I'm just gonna have a few more introductory videos, I’ll show you I hopefully

71
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,935
make one where I’ll

72
00:03:53,935 --> 00:03:57,311
show you a bunch of your project that are kinda that you might think of as

73
00:03:57,311 --> 00:04:00,229
possible outcomes or that relate to the kinds of things were going to be doing

74
00:04:00,229 --> 00:04:00,832
in this

75
00:04:00,832 --> 00:04:01,092
a video series so there's a bunch more intro videos that i'm gonna make, they’ll be

76
00:04:01,092 --> 00:04:07,737
short five-minute videos that you can watch, but at any point

77
00:04:07,737 --> 00:04:12,402
you could just stopped completely and go out, you know chess is a fun game

78
00:04:12,402 --> 00:04:15,758
uhm, I don't know

79
00:04:15,758 --> 00:04:19,319
put a basketball is nice, music, learning to play the violin

80
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:23,277
I did that for a while, it was very enjoyable because it's something else

81
00:04:23,277 --> 00:04:26,745
or if or you can jump ahead, argh, this turned off

82
00:04:26,745 --> 00:04:30,828
I have a

83
00:04:30,828 --> 00:04:33,862
camera turning off problem, or you could jump ahead and kinda get to the point

84
00:04:33,862 --> 00:04:35,618
where you think you’re ready to go to

85
00:04:35,618 --> 00:04:40,344
okay hopefully it's going to be fine that’s the end of this video
