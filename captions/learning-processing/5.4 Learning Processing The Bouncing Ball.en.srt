1
00:00:00,985 --> 00:00:03,908
Ok, so we're getting to an exciting moment!

2
00:00:03,908 --> 00:00:05,536
this is an exciting moment in time,

3
00:00:05,536 --> 00:00:09,917
you know, what are we really doing here? 
I have no idea but we are

4
00:00:09,917 --> 00:00:11,145
getting to the point where

5
00:00:11,145 --> 00:00:16,801
we are almost ready for this circle,
when it reaches this edge of the window

6
00:00:16,801 --> 00:00:18,655
to turn around and come back!

7
00:00:18,655 --> 00:00:20,919
come on, you can do it! ok, almost!

8
00:00:20,919 --> 00:00:22,553
we are getting there, we are ready to do that!

9
00:00:22,553 --> 00:00:24,083
so how are we going to do that?

10
00:00:25,263 --> 00:00:26,646
we're going to use a conditional statement

11
00:00:26,646 --> 00:00:29,177
that's what the last two videos, 
that you may or may not have watched,

12
00:00:29,177 --> 00:00:34,719
(unintelligible) complete disasters ...
(unintelligible)

13
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:36,862
we're demonstrating how conditional 
statements work.

14
00:00:36,862 --> 00:00:41,424
well, let's take a look at our scenario here:

15
00:00:41,424 --> 00:00:43,833
we have a Processing window,
we've got a circle in that Processing window.

16
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:51,674
the circle is draw at an x-location of circleX,
that is the circle's x-location

17
00:00:51,674 --> 00:00:55,643
the circle moves every frame a certain amount

18
00:00:55,643 --> 00:01:02,725
in our program here we can see it says:
circleX = circleX + 2;

19
00:01:02,725 --> 00:01:09,392
so it moves 2 pixels every frame, 
and we can think of that as

20
00:01:09,392 --> 00:01:15,339
the xSpeed, for example, 
that's the speed it's moving along the x-axis

21
00:01:15,339 --> 00:01:19,119
you know, this should really ring a bell for you!

22
00:01:20,059 --> 00:01:23,379
what's the thing that we wanna add 
to our program if we're talking about

23
00:01:23,379 --> 00:01:27,483
the fact that there is this value that goes here 
that we could name xSpeed?

24
00:01:27,483 --> 00:01:29,378
well, we should have a variable for that!

25
00:01:29,378 --> 00:01:31,712
and I kinda jumped the gun with this

26
00:01:31,712 --> 00:01:33,242
because that's something we're going to discover

27
00:01:33,242 --> 00:01:35,159
if I had not mentioned that right now, we would

28
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:38,888
discover this in a moment, we need that to be 
a variable to execute our task

29
00:01:38,888 --> 00:01:41,886
but I'm just gonna add another variable at the top

30
00:01:41,886 --> 00:01:43,992
I'm going to call it xSpeed = 2;

31
00:01:43,992 --> 00:01:47,116
and we're going to say: 
circleX = circleX + xSpeed;

32
00:01:47,116 --> 00:01:50,123
the nice thing about this is if I decide I want
the circle to be really slow

33
00:01:50,123 --> 00:01:52,700
because I want it to be really dramatic

34
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:58,605
I could change that to .2 and you see
we're moving very, very, very , very slowly

35
00:01:58,605 --> 00:02:01,366
across the screen. so we let that go for a little bit

36
00:02:01,366 --> 00:02:04,333
we can talk and see if we can get back here
before it reaches the end

37
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:06,121
that's a good challenge!
still only two minutes so far!

38
00:02:06,121 --> 00:02:07,055
we're doing well!

39
00:02:07,475 --> 00:02:09,823
ok, so first we have to decide for ourselves

40
00:02:09,823 --> 00:02:13,781
what's our condition for when the circle
reaches the edge?

41
00:02:13,781 --> 00:02:18,132
well, you can say: if the circle's x-location

42
00:02:18,132 --> 00:02:20,801
is at the width of the window,

43
00:02:20,801 --> 00:02:22,832
but what does it mean to say: 
at the width of the window?

44
00:02:22,832 --> 00:02:25,800
maybe you want to say:
if it EQUALS the width of the window

45
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:34,538
if circleX equals width

46
00:02:34,538 --> 00:02:37,506
turn around, that's what we want to say

47
00:02:37,506 --> 00:02:38,944
turn around.

48
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:42,299
so this is reasonable but it's a bit

49
00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:43,663
of a problem - it's not there yet!

50
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:46,193
the little ball is still going! 
let's go over there and stop it!

51
00:02:46,193 --> 00:02:48,497
ok, let's add that bit of code

52
00:02:49,617 --> 00:02:57,214
and I'm gonna say: if circleX equals 
the width of the window

53
00:02:57,214 --> 00:02:59,912
do something. now, I'm gonna just 
print a statement

54
00:02:59,912 --> 00:03:01,599
turn around

55
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:08,900
so, and I will also not have it go .2 pixels, 
let's have it go at 2 pixels

56
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:12,119
and let's run and see what happens

57
00:03:15,259 --> 00:03:17,378
oh, I lost my line of code ...

58
00:03:17,378 --> 00:03:24,953
so [unintelligible] 
circleX = circleX + xSpeed;

59
00:03:28,073 --> 00:03:28,866
run this again

60
00:03:28,866 --> 00:03:31,272
it's going, it's going, it's going

61
00:03:31,272 --> 00:03:34,002
in a moment we should see a little message

62
00:03:34,002 --> 00:03:36,762
pop up ... ah, you saw that?

63
00:03:36,762 --> 00:03:38,333
so it reached the edge and printed 'turn around'

64
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:39,701
I'm sure you can't read it says 'turn around'

65
00:03:39,701 --> 00:03:40,857
but it says 'turn around'

66
00:03:42,277 --> 00:03:44,993
hm, is that out the screen? 
no, it's not out of the screen

67
00:03:44,993 --> 00:03:46,252
it's just out of my preview

68
00:03:46,252 --> 00:03:50,012
just ignore me, this is all magic
how this all works

69
00:03:50,012 --> 00:03:53,835
ok, see this is the problem: 
I'm just like losing my train of thought

70
00:03:53,835 --> 00:03:54,606
and a minute goes by

71
00:03:54,606 --> 00:03:57,155
ok, we see, but what's the problem 
with this statement?

72
00:03:57,155 --> 00:04:00,064
this is a big problem, 
this is kind of good but it's not great

73
00:04:00,064 --> 00:04:07,613
what if I'd say: xSpeed = 2.8whatever
this is really important, this is exactly

74
00:04:07,613 --> 00:04:10,584
what I always imagined xSpeed to be!

75
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:16,165
I mean, come on, 2.8whatever, 
that's such a good speed! right?

76
00:04:16,165 --> 00:04:21,245
ok, here it goes, it's gonna get to the edge ...

77
00:04:21,245 --> 00:04:23,192
nothing printed out! why?

78
00:04:23,192 --> 00:04:25,153
because if you add this up a bunch of times

79
00:04:25,153 --> 00:04:28,475
it's not going to be exactly 360 pixels

80
00:04:28,475 --> 00:04:32,237
so a much better way of doing this
would be to say:

81
00:04:32,237 --> 00:04:36,089
if circleX is greater than, or equal to, width

82
00:04:36,089 --> 00:04:40,556
this way if it just so happens that it's here
and the next frame it would be here

83
00:04:40,556 --> 00:04:42,361
we're still gonna register that!

84
00:04:42,361 --> 00:04:46,443
as long as it's gotten past the window
now we wanna execute some task

85
00:04:46,443 --> 00:04:50,276
so it's a little bit of a digression, just with 
how you deal with something along the edge

86
00:04:50,276 --> 00:04:51,880
but an important one nonetheless.

87
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,506
'greater than' is much better than 'equals to'

88
00:04:54,506 --> 00:04:57,118
ok, we're at 5 minutes, that's ok

89
00:04:57,118 --> 00:05:01,846
ok, so now we're good and we're going to say:
if it's greater than width

90
00:05:01,846 --> 00:05:04,639
now just to be simple for a second,

91
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:10,866
I'm gonna say, how would you say? ok, 
what would you write there

92
00:05:10,866 --> 00:05:12,503
to have it turn around?

93
00:05:12,503 --> 00:05:14,565
well, how do you get it to go forward?

94
00:05:14,565 --> 00:05:19,263
to get it to go forward you say:
circleX = circleX + xSpeed; right?

95
00:05:19,263 --> 00:05:24,794
so to go backwards you'd say:
circleX = circleX - xSpeed;

96
00:05:24,794 --> 00:05:28,086
so if it gets greater than width then
why we don't just tell it to go backwards?

97
00:05:28,086 --> 00:05:31,542
ok, that sounds good! I don't know, 
I like your line of reasoning there!

98
00:05:31,542 --> 00:05:32,697
that was pretty reasonable!

99
00:05:32,697 --> 00:05:33,832
that was what you were thinking, right?

100
00:05:33,832 --> 00:05:35,700
that's not what I was thinking
but that's because I already did it before

101
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:40,093
so, circleX = circleX - xSpeed;

102
00:05:40,093 --> 00:05:42,501
let's run that! that seems pretty good.

103
00:05:42,501 --> 00:05:45,885
it's getting to the edge,

104
00:05:45,885 --> 00:05:46,881
very dramatic, what's going to happen?

105
00:05:46,881 --> 00:05:48,085
boo, that's kind of a good effect

106
00:05:48,085 --> 00:05:49,614
we got it to stop at the edge

107
00:05:49,614 --> 00:05:50,650
this is a big moment for us!

108
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,406
it stopped at the edge. but is it
really stopping at the edge?

109
00:05:53,406 --> 00:05:56,971
this is where you really, 
first of all we could debug this problem

110
00:05:56,971 --> 00:06:00,343
by putting a print statement in there
and see what the value of circleX is

111
00:06:00,343 --> 00:06:04,255
but this is not right, we need to figure out 
how to get it to turn around

112
00:06:05,695 --> 00:06:08,061
it's not turning around. so what's happening here?

113
00:06:08,061 --> 00:06:12,996
ok, so let's just say for a moment
that the value of circleX starts at 0

114
00:06:12,996 --> 00:06:14,993
and let's give it a speed of 10

115
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,724
so it's like superfast

116
00:06:17,724 --> 00:06:21,626
this is like the fastest circle moving across
the screen I've ever seen

117
00:06:21,626 --> 00:06:22,454
boom, it's stuck there

118
00:06:22,454 --> 00:06:24,806
it's 10, is that greater than width?

119
00:06:24,806 --> 00:06:27,151
no, so it's 20, is that greater than width? no.

120
00:06:27,151 --> 00:06:28,597
so it's 30, it's that greater than width? no.

121
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:31,381
it's doing that over and over again, 
eventually it gets to be 350,

122
00:06:31,381 --> 00:06:35,702
is that greater than width? no, 360? no.
370? yes!

123
00:06:35,702 --> 00:06:44,158
so we know say circleX is 370 which equals
370-10=360, is that greater than width?

124
00:06:44,158 --> 00:06:48,889
no. so it's stuck at the edge, 
we don't wanna ...

125
00:06:48,889 --> 00:06:52,645
what this code is saying, is that 
when it gets to the edge, have it go

126
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:54,615
back one time, and then keep going forward

127
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:58,252
and then go back one time, and keep
going forward. we don't want to do that!

128
00:06:58,252 --> 00:07:01,135
we want to say: have it permanently start
to go backwards!

129
00:07:01,135 --> 00:07:03,927
so how do we have it permanently 
start to go backwards?

130
00:07:03,927 --> 00:07:06,959
well, why is it permanently going forward
in the first place?

131
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:11,311
it's permanently going forwards 
because its xSpeed is 10.

132
00:07:11,311 --> 00:07:15,706
so what if I actually here manipulate its
xSpeed value and said:

133
00:07:15,706 --> 00:07:17,781
xSpeed = -10; ?

134
00:07:19,951 --> 00:07:25,061
it's zooming across and BOOM, it's
zooming back again, and oh, it's gone again!

135
00:07:25,061 --> 00:07:27,851
we can accomplish that though!
we can deal with that!

136
00:07:27,851 --> 00:07:28,685
we can handle it!

137
00:07:28,685 --> 00:07:35,143
if circleX is less than 0
set it to go forward

138
00:07:35,143 --> 00:07:39,615
boom ... boom ... boom ...

139
00:07:39,615 --> 00:07:41,106
we have a bouncing ball!!

140
00:07:41,106 --> 00:07:43,276
ladies and gentlemen,
this is very exciting!

141
00:07:43,276 --> 00:07:44,179
this is a big moment!

142
00:07:44,179 --> 00:07:47,318
what we have now is two conditional statements

143
00:07:47,318 --> 00:07:53,338
one ... one ... I'm so confused 
I wish to be drawing this but

144
00:07:53,338 --> 00:07:54,484
now I just got this thing here

145
00:07:54,484 --> 00:08:00,380
one is telling it to whenever it reaches 
the right hand-side of the screen

146
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,037
to set its speed to be negative

147
00:08:02,037 --> 00:08:05,525
and whenever it reaches the left-hand side 
of the screen to set its speed to positive

148
00:08:05,525 --> 00:08:06,862
here is the thing:

149
00:08:06,862 --> 00:08:10,786
if you're thinking about this, 
if you've learned about,

150
00:08:10,786 --> 00:08:14,108
if you've watched our overly long video
about logical operators

151
00:08:14,108 --> 00:08:15,347
that had AND and OR in it

152
00:08:15,347 --> 00:08:18,711
could we say more generically:

153
00:08:18,711 --> 00:08:21,306
if it gets to one side of the screen

154
00:08:23,106 --> 00:08:27,355
or if it reaches the other side of the screen

155
00:08:27,355 --> 00:08:28,598
turn around!

156
00:08:29,648 --> 00:08:32,208
how could we say: turn around?

157
00:08:35,018 --> 00:08:36,105
well, let's think for a moment:

158
00:08:39,495 --> 00:08:44,334
10 means going this way,
-10 means going this way,

159
00:08:44,334 --> 00:08:47,686
so if the value is 10 ,
we want it to switch to -10

160
00:08:47,686 --> 00:08:51,157
if the value is -10 
then we want to switch it to be 10

161
00:08:51,157 --> 00:08:53,293
how do we reverse the polarity of a number?

162
00:08:53,293 --> 00:08:56,206
if it's positive to make it negative,
if it's negative to make it positive?

163
00:08:56,206 --> 00:08:58,706
multiply it by -1 !

164
00:08:58,706 --> 00:08:59,967
then we get -10

165
00:08:59,967 --> 00:09:01,072
10 times -1 is - 10

166
00:09:01,072 --> 00:09:04,955
-10 times - 1 is 10

167
00:09:04,955 --> 00:09:05,414
genius!

168
00:09:05,414 --> 00:09:14,060
so here we go and we say:
xSpeed equals xSpeed times -1

169
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:19,705
and we now have exactly the same effect

170
00:09:19,705 --> 00:09:21,412
but we've reduced it into one statement

171
00:09:21,412 --> 00:09:24,496
if it's greater than width
OR if it's less than 0

172
00:09:24,496 --> 00:09:26,601
reverse the speed of that

173
00:09:26,601 --> 00:09:30,046
now there's a couple of things you might
try to do as an exercise now that

174
00:09:30,046 --> 00:09:32,391
you've watched this video:
1. add y

175
00:09:32,391 --> 00:09:34,381
try to bounce it along the y-axis

176
00:09:34,381 --> 00:09:38,672
2. is having it speed up or slow down

177
00:09:38,672 --> 00:09:40,597
each time it hits the wall

178
00:09:40,597 --> 00:09:42,732
this is kind of an interesting problem

179
00:09:42,732 --> 00:09:43,824
and I'm actually gonna show you 
in a second

180
00:09:43,824 --> 00:09:47,400
so if you don't want the answer to how you can
slow it down, pause the video for a second

181
00:09:47,400 --> 00:10:03,786
[unrelated stuff]

182
00:10:03,786 --> 00:10:05,264
so, the other things that you should try is

183
00:10:05,264 --> 00:10:09,523
to think about gravity, so how do you 
make gravity work. and maybe I'll

184
00:10:09,523 --> 00:10:12,460
do a little video about that but 
that's sort of part 3, that's a litte advanced

185
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,584
we have this system where we
[unintelligible] three exercises

186
00:10:14,584 --> 00:10:19,741
like right below you, like on this browser page,
but whatever ...

187
00:10:19,741 --> 00:10:23,241
so, anyway, just as an interesting little token

188
00:10:23,241 --> 00:10:26,458
we could do something like have it 
always slow down.

189
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:28,156
this is gonna cause us a problem though

190
00:10:28,156 --> 00:10:37,966
watch, aaah, [unrelated]

191
00:10:37,966 --> 00:10:39,583
so I'm actually gonna leave this here

192
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:41,843
I'm gonna leave this as this open question

193
00:10:41,843 --> 00:10:43,487
why did this not work?

194
00:10:43,487 --> 00:10:45,862
why did it suddenly get stuck?

195
00:10:45,862 --> 00:10:48,363
I mean if I increase the speed, it's not 
gonna get stuck

196
00:10:48,363 --> 00:10:54,008
and let's start it a little slower
cause it's gonna happen to quickly

197
00:10:54,008 --> 00:10:58,238
so let's say each time it hits a boundary
speed up a little bit

198
00:10:58,238 --> 00:11:00,382
multiply yourself by 1.1

199
00:11:00,382 --> 00:11:02,038
so you're speeding up by 10%

200
00:11:02,038 --> 00:11:04,173
you can see each time it hits the wall

201
00:11:04,173 --> 00:11:05,673
it starts to go a little bit faster

202
00:11:05,673 --> 00:11:11,224
faster ... and faster ... and faster...

203
00:11:11,224 --> 00:11:12,383
you can watch it on your own time

204
00:11:12,383 --> 00:11:15,306
cause I only got ...although we're still recording ...

205
00:11:15,306 --> 00:11:16,983
I still got 10 seconds left

206
00:11:16,983 --> 00:11:19,444
but as an exercise and I get back to this:

207
00:11:19,444 --> 00:11:23,411
why does this break it?
figure that out!
