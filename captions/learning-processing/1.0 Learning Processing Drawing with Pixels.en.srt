1
00:00:02,005 --> 00:00:03,094
We are ready to begin

2
00:00:03,139 --> 00:00:08,920
a new set videos. The first set of videos were
all just introductions, "Where are we?

3
00:00:08,092 --> 00:00:11,231
What's the world coming to?" All that
kind of stuff and now we're going to

4
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:15,240
begin actually looking at the practical
reality of writing code.

5
00:00:15,024 --> 00:00:19,065
Now, we're doing something in this
"Whatever you wanna call it"

6
00:00:19,065 --> 00:00:23,074
video series which is we are learning

7
00:00:23,104 --> 00:00:26,670
about computer programming, the
foundations of computing through the

8
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:28,436
lens of computer graphics,

9
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:33,210
drawing to the screen. So, actually in this
very first video in this series of a bunch

10
00:00:33,021 --> 00:00:36,073
we're not going to write instructions
just yet.

11
00:00:36,073 --> 00:00:40,052
We're going to begin by just feeling
comfortable, getting together,

12
00:00:40,062 --> 00:00:44,073
having a moment, and understanding what
it means to draw

13
00:00:44,073 --> 00:00:47,085
pixels to the screen. What is the 
coordinate system of the screen?

14
00:00:47,085 --> 00:00:51,064
What does it mean to draw a point, a line,
a rectangle? How do we actually

15
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:56,027
put stuff onto that? So, this should be a
short video we're gonna do this video first

16
00:00:56,067 --> 00:01:00,069
then we'll actually look at opening up
Processing, how Processing works, and writing

17
00:01:00,069 --> 00:01:02,002
code to implement our drawings,

18
00:01:02,032 --> 00:01:05,040
then we'll add color and do all sorts of
other stuff as well.

19
00:01:05,004 --> 00:01:09,877
So, what's the beginning? What's the
first thing that we need to understand?

20
00:01:09,877 --> 00:01:10,873
When we

21
00:01:10,903 --> 00:01:13,892
write our first Proccessing program, which

22
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:17,310
we'll eventually call it a sketch,

23
00:01:17,031 --> 00:01:22,438
what happens is a window opens and here is
what happens. We can represent this window

24
00:01:22,438 --> 00:01:23,414
by drawing a

25
00:01:23,414 --> 00:01:27,038
rectangle over here. This is our computer
graphics window. All of the instructions

26
00:01:27,038 --> 00:01:32,004
we write as we learn about all this stuff
about foundations of computation,

27
00:01:32,024 --> 00:01:35,713
we're gonna write instructions that are gonna draw
stuff to the screen.

28
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:40,729
You know, it's important to note though
that this is a small fraction percentage

29
00:01:40,729 --> 00:01:43,180
of what you can do with computation,
right? Draw,

30
00:01:43,018 --> 00:01:47,567
make drawings. It's just a nice way to begin
but, you know,

31
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:50,208
you should realize that you're not limited

32
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:53,613
to this world of drawing to the screen. You will go
out and

33
00:01:53,619 --> 00:01:56,890
solve all sorts of interesting problems
and create all sorts of wonderous

34
00:01:56,089 --> 00:02:00,658
things with the power of computation but we're
going to start, you know, we're going to

35
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:01,997
be super excited when there's

36
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:05,251
know a red circle in the middle of the screen.
We're gonna think we

37
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:08,393
really achieved something brilliant. Okay,
so we have this

38
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,260
rectangle, boy am I long winded.
You might have

39
00:02:12,026 --> 00:02:15,345
one time in your life taken a

40
00:02:15,349 --> 00:02:18,680
math course, a geometry course, some sort of
course

41
00:02:18,068 --> 00:02:22,043
where you drew something that looked
like this. The Cartesian coordinate

42
00:02:22,053 --> 00:02:24,974
system maybe you had graph paper even.

43
00:02:25,004 --> 00:02:28,087
The graph paper is a great thing. If you
have any graph paper lying around

44
00:02:28,087 --> 00:02:30,076
the house go pause,

45
00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:33,660
go and get it, and pull it out. You'll be very
happy you have graph paper. But when

46
00:02:33,066 --> 00:02:40,095
you have a Cartesian coordinate system, you add
something called the "x-axis".

47
00:02:40,115 --> 00:02:41,105
I'll walk over here.

48
00:02:41,105 --> 00:02:45,250
Then you add something called the "y-axis". And
then we could say, "Oh look, there's a

49
00:02:45,025 --> 00:02:46,038
point over here".

50
00:02:46,038 --> 00:02:49,094
What is that point? Maybe it's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

51
00:02:49,094 --> 00:02:53,513
1, 2, 3, 4. And were gonna say, hey, it's

52
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:58,690
5 comma 4 meaning its

53
00:02:58,069 --> 00:03:01,798
x equals 5, right, with this point over here.

54
00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:05,200
The center being your origin. (0, 0)
Right?

55
00:03:05,002 --> 00:03:10,066
and this is 5 comma 4 and why,
excuse me, 1, 2, 3, 4, right?

56
00:03:10,084 --> 00:03:15,263
This should feel somewhat intuitive, somewhat
familiar to you, right?

57
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:19,180
This is this idea, you have this coordinate system
and we can locate

58
00:03:19,018 --> 00:03:23,075
spots on the coordinate system by their
numeric numeric horizontal value, x, by their

59
00:03:23,075 --> 00:03:27,524
numeric vertical value, y. We're going to do
this

60
00:03:27,549 --> 00:03:30,750
same exact thing in computer graphics only
the

61
00:03:30,075 --> 00:03:33,078
coordinate system is going to be
slightly different. You know, one thing I

62
00:03:33,078 --> 00:03:37,457
should mention is, what is this point
here?

63
00:03:37,457 --> 00:03:39,849
This point is 1 comma -3,

64
00:03:39,849 --> 00:03:43,863
right? This is positive 1, 2, 3, 4, negative
points down.

65
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:49,450
-1 -2 -3. And here's -1 -2 -3 along the
x-axis.

66
00:03:49,045 --> 00:03:51,654
So, we have this idea of this
coordinate system with

67
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:55,010
(0, 0) in the center, positive x going
to the right,

68
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:58,092
positive y going up. Now, in computer
graphics,

69
00:03:58,092 --> 00:04:02,481
we have something similar to this but

70
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:06,290
flipped and with (0, 0) in a different place,
right? A computer graphics window,

71
00:04:06,029 --> 00:04:09,808
right, here's a window. This is actually
Processing but you can see, we can say, hey that's the

72
00:04:09,829 --> 00:04:10,930
top left of this

73
00:04:10,093 --> 00:04:16,322
window which is this big rectangle on screen.
The top left of any computer graphics window

74
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:19,600
is the origin, (0, 0)

75
00:04:19,005 --> 00:04:24,435
and this is the x-axis going this way,

76
00:04:24,449 --> 00:04:28,820
and this is the y-axis going this way.

77
00:04:28,082 --> 00:04:33,039
But we should note something:

78
00:04:33,052 --> 00:04:36,085
What is this point?

79
00:04:36,085 --> 00:04:39,993
This is the point 5

80
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:43,016
comma 4, right?

81
00:04:43,043 --> 00:04:46,091
This was 5 comma 4 in this
coordinate system,

82
00:04:46,091 --> 00:04:50,015
This is 5 comma 4. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

83
00:04:50,031 --> 00:04:53,990
1, 2, 3, 4 in this coordinate system.

84
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,169
y is positive pointing down, x is positive
pointing to the right.

85
00:04:58,169 --> 00:05:01,361
????!!!!

86
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:05,815
I don't know, I feel at ease
with this but I don't know if

87
00:05:05,849 --> 00:05:08,010
this makes you uncomfortable or its just like,
oh my God,

88
00:05:08,001 --> 00:05:11,053
I can't believe you're still talking about where the
point 5 comma 4 is. But,

89
00:05:11,053 --> 00:05:15,985
what we should note here is it
doesn't make sense to have negative pixels,

90
00:05:16,005 --> 00:05:20,011
right? So, all the pixels within our window
are positive numbers.

91
00:05:20,011 --> 00:05:23,072
There's no such thing as a negative pixel.
Now of course,

92
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:27,921
all of this could be-is going to
change

93
00:05:27,921 --> 00:05:31,947
as we look at more advanced environments. 
There's certainly ways, when we get into 3D,

94
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:33,710
where (0, 0) you want to consider at the

95
00:05:33,071 --> 00:05:37,051
center. There are all sorts of reasons
why you might consider negative numbers

96
00:05:37,051 --> 00:05:37,995
versus positive numbers

97
00:05:38,025 --> 00:05:42,068
but we're starting at a very simple, nice
friendly, happy-go-lucky place

98
00:05:42,068 --> 00:05:47,013
where we just have (0, 0) in the
top-left, positive x to the right,

99
00:05:47,018 --> 00:05:48,096
positive y going down.

100
00:05:48,096 --> 00:05:52,012
Now, you might be wondering, boy you took a
very long time to

101
00:05:52,022 --> 00:05:56,076
explain that and I'm not sure why I did but
hopefully that was helpful.

102
00:05:56,076 --> 00:06:01,035
So, the reason why we really need to be
comfortable with this

103
00:06:01,035 --> 00:06:05,016
is because as we start to write
instructions to draw to the screen,

104
00:06:05,026 --> 00:06:08,097
the way we're going to say, hey,
put a rectangle here

105
00:06:08,097 --> 00:06:12,993
at this (x, y) location with this width in
pixels with this height in pixels.

106
00:06:13,013 --> 00:06:16,019
Draw a line from this (x, y) to this
(x, y) location.

107
00:06:16,019 --> 00:06:19,032
So, this idea of being comfortable with
an x axis, a y axis,

108
00:06:19,032 --> 00:06:22,038
and this kind of scale of pixels is important to
realize.

109
00:06:22,038 --> 00:06:25,072
Now, let's take this, I have an eraser somewhere.

110
00:06:25,072 --> 00:06:30,094
Let's take this a few steps further. Now that we're
comfortable with our

111
00:06:30,094 --> 00:06:34,991
coordinate system, let's start to understand how
we might write an

112
00:06:35,001 --> 00:06:38,014
instruction, right, we want to draw to
the screen.

113
00:06:38,014 --> 00:06:43,022
How might we write an instruction to draw
to the screen? So, let's start with

114
00:06:43,094 --> 00:06:47,041
something a little different than I
expected.

115
00:06:47,051 --> 00:06:50,073
That's gonna be shocking to you, I going to start with a
line

116
00:06:50,073 --> 00:06:55,021
instead of a rectangle. A rectangle is often the first example but let's start with a line. So, let's say

117
00:06:55,072 --> 00:07:00,015
here is our window and the only other thing
about a window, we need to define,

118
00:07:00,035 --> 00:07:03,059
any window we need to define a width and
height. So,

119
00:07:03,059 --> 00:07:06,063
let's say, I think most of the Processing
examples

120
00:07:06,063 --> 00:07:10,031
tend to start with width of 640 pixels

121
00:07:10,031 --> 00:07:14,089
and height 360 pixels. This is drawn relatively
to scale.

122
00:07:14,089 --> 00:07:19,090
So. that's all another you wanna realize.
If this is (0, 0) in the top left,

123
00:07:19,099 --> 00:07:22,994
what is this pixel in the middle? It would
be

124
00:07:23,024 --> 00:07:26,041
half way to 640 which we could do that math
in our head

125
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:30,069
<i>math</i> 320. Halfway

126
00:07:30,069 --> 00:07:33,094
right down with 360 at the bottom, comma
180.

127
00:07:33,094 --> 00:07:37,565
Right, so, this is what we need to start
getting used to, this idea scale we're

128
00:07:37,565 --> 00:07:38,036
not thinking of, well

129
00:07:38,066 --> 00:07:41,085
it's two meters to the wall or three feet
this way.

130
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:44,085
We're always going to be thinking in pixels and generally,

131
00:07:44,085 --> 00:07:48,039
you know, what are we talking about? Something 
that's full screen which is like 1920 by 1080

132
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:52,029
or is it a small window 200 by 200.
It really depends. Am I making a print,

133
00:07:52,065 --> 00:07:55,052
an instilation, a little game for the
web?

134
00:07:55,062 --> 00:07:58,065
What what type of scale? We're working generally
in this scale.

135
00:07:58,092 --> 00:08:02,998
Okay so, let's just say that what we want
to do

136
00:08:03,008 --> 00:08:06,010
is we decided we could design a
little picture

137
00:08:06,001 --> 00:08:10,028
by making a bunch of lines. You know, maybe
the lines are like this.

138
00:08:10,037 --> 00:08:15,043
We're gonna make a face
with a nose.

139
00:08:15,043 --> 00:08:19,072
So, we could imagine that what if we could draw
all these lines on the screen

140
00:08:19,072 --> 00:08:22,098
we could create this pattern of this

141
00:08:22,098 --> 00:08:26,999
of this very serene face. So, we need to
understand,

142
00:08:27,008 --> 00:08:31,016
what does it mean to write an
instruction to draw a line

143
00:08:31,016 --> 00:08:34,049
on the screen? And let actually just even do,

144
00:08:34,005 --> 00:08:37,994
let's just do this. I'm going to arbitrarily
make something up.

145
00:08:38,004 --> 00:08:43,002
I'm drawing little circles here to
indicate the beginning

146
00:08:43,018 --> 00:08:46,023
and end of the line. So,

147
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:49,956
I don't have anyone to talk to here but you're, kinda, if you're watching this

148
00:08:50,006 --> 00:08:53,031
still, somehow, you're
thinking along with me.

149
00:08:53,031 --> 00:08:56,999
What do we need to
define how to draw a line?

150
00:08:57,019 --> 00:09:00,045
What we're looking for is how to write
the instruction

151
00:09:00,045 --> 00:09:04,008
to draw a line. Once we figure that
out, we're gonna maybe understand how to

152
00:09:04,038 --> 00:09:07,989
write the instruction to draw a rectangle,
to draw a circle, to draw a curve,

153
00:09:08,029 --> 00:09:12,092
to draw a polygon. All sorts of elaborate shapes
and designs that we might want make.

154
00:09:12,092 --> 00:09:17,008
But with the line, you might say hey, a line is

155
00:09:17,008 --> 00:09:21,031
a bunch of pixels between 
point A and point B.

156
00:09:21,031 --> 00:09:25,987
We can call this point A, we can call this
point B. What do we need to define

157
00:09:26,007 --> 00:09:27,055
each of those points?

158
00:09:27,055 --> 00:09:30,055
An (x, y). We might say this is

159
00:09:30,055 --> 00:09:31,971
(x1, y1) and this

160
00:09:32,015 --> 00:09:36,054
(x2, y2), right? So, to draw a line
we might say,

161
00:09:36,054 --> 00:09:39,071
in English we might say, "draw a line

162
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:43,089
between" and here we can, say let's

163
00:09:43,089 --> 00:09:46,093
make up some numbers. Here, maybe this is
about 100, 200, 300, 400.

164
00:09:46,093 --> 00:09:49,979
Maybe this is about pixel 100 and this is about pixel 50.

165
00:09:50,009 --> 00:09:53,061
"Draw a line between (100, 50) to"

166
00:09:53,061 --> 00:09:57,079
Maybe this is, like, pixel 600

167
00:09:57,079 --> 00:10:01,080
and this is pixel 250. I'm kind of making

168
00:10:01,008 --> 00:10:06,024
this up. "To (600, 250)"

169
00:10:06,036 --> 00:10:10,002
Right, this how you would write that
English. "Draw a line

170
00:10:10,022 --> 00:10:13,083
between (100, 50) to (600, 250)".

171
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:17,042
We draw that that line. How do we write
this

172
00:10:17,062 --> 00:10:21,064
in code? We don't know! This is where

173
00:10:21,064 --> 00:10:25,079
learning to program comes in. One of the things we
have to learn is syntax.

174
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:28,980
So, while we kind of all have a generic
understanding the syntax of the

175
00:10:29,006 --> 00:10:32,973
English language or whatever language
you might speak in,

176
00:10:33,017 --> 00:10:36,099
you're not familiar with the
syntax of Processing.

177
00:10:36,099 --> 00:10:40,002
So, I'll show you what it is. This is the
syntax

178
00:10:40,022 --> 00:10:44,026
"line 100

179
00:10:44,062 --> 00:10:48,069
comma 50 comma 600

180
00:10:48,069 --> 00:10:51,086
comma 250" So, here you go.

181
00:10:51,086 --> 00:10:54,091
This is our first line of code

182
00:10:54,091 --> 00:10:57,092
that we are ever writing in our
entire lives,

183
00:10:57,092 --> 00:11:02,098
for dramatic effect. Were saying line
parentheses a number comma

184
00:11:02,098 --> 00:11:06,005
another number comma another number comma
another number parentheses and semicolon.

185
00:11:06,025 --> 00:11:12,434
And in fact, this is where we begin.
Everything that we're going to write

186
00:11:12,459 --> 00:11:16,490
in this first beginning set
of videos,

187
00:11:16,049 --> 00:11:20,991
I'm forgetting that the camera is there. Hello! 
Has this format.

188
00:11:21,011 --> 00:11:24,550
It has, what we're gonna say is, a function
name,

189
00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:29,130
can you see that? Yes.
Followed by a parentheses,

190
00:11:29,013 --> 00:11:32,972
followed by some set of arguments. We're going to call these

191
00:11:33,089 --> 00:11:38,220
arguments which are values separated by
commas.

192
00:11:38,022 --> 00:11:41,881
Ending with a parentheses and ending
with a semicolon.

193
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,430
What does this mean exactly?

194
00:11:45,043 --> 00:11:48,049
You can think of this as a command for
now.

195
00:11:48,049 --> 00:11:53,082
Truly, it's a function or a method or a
procedure. There's lots of different words for this.

196
00:11:53,082 --> 00:11:59,681
Function, I think, will be the word we use
continuously. But, we can think of this as a command. I command you

197
00:11:59,709 --> 00:12:03,230
to draw a line. Arguments are the
parameters

198
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:06,057
that define how we're gonna execute that command.

199
00:12:06,057 --> 00:12:09,786
If I'm trying to program you, I could
say, "walk" or

200
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,360
i could say, "walk fast" or I could say, "walk to this location".

201
00:12:13,036 --> 00:12:17,995
"Fast" or "this location", those are arguments to the
command, the function, walk.

202
00:12:18,025 --> 00:12:21,079
So, everything we write and the first ones
we're going to learn

203
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:26,016
are like rectangle, ellipse,

204
00:12:26,026 --> 00:12:29,087
we just did line already,

205
00:12:29,087 --> 00:12:33,088
and a point. So, this, I think, is a nice, easy
place for us to start.

206
00:12:33,097 --> 00:12:37,009
How do we define a rectangle? How do we
define an ellipse?

207
00:12:37,029 --> 00:12:41,036
How do we define a line? How do we define
a point? What are the arguments for each

208
00:12:41,036 --> 00:12:41,984
one of those?

209
00:12:42,016 --> 00:12:45,021
We can then draw rectangles, ellipses,
lines, points. So,

210
00:12:45,066 --> 00:12:49,905
what I would suggest to you, here your
exercise for the end of this video,

211
00:12:49,949 --> 00:12:52,918
what you should do with come up with
some design that

212
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:57,267
you would just draw with pencil and
paper, if you've got graph paper, fantastic.

213
00:12:57,319 --> 00:13:01,697
Draw that design. Make it simple. Only use
rectangles, circle, ellipses,

214
00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:04,717
circles, lines, and points,

215
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:10,040
and then try to guess, what would the
instructions look like with this kind of

216
00:13:10,004 --> 00:13:14,293
syntax. What arguments
make sense for drawing a rectangle?

217
00:13:14,329 --> 00:13:19,329
Hint: The location, width, and height. What arguments
make sense for an ellipse?

218
00:13:19,329 --> 00:13:23,941
For a line? For a point? Try to come up with
something and in the next video we're gonna starting seeing the

219
00:13:23,949 --> 00:13:27,628
answers to some of these questions, we're gonna 
start putting this code into Processing,

220
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:31,152
executing it, and seeing our first programs
run. I don't know-

221
00:13:31,169 --> 00:13:34,937
I forgot to set a timer so i dont know how long
this was but i was hoping it's just about five or

222
00:13:34,949 --> 00:13:35,744
six minutes.

223
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:39,844
Then you're probably looking down and it's like 20 minuts long or something. Anyway, I'll see you in the next

224
00:13:40,249 --> 00:13:44,250
video if you choose to watch, which is
totally reasonable

225
00:13:44,259 --> 00:13:47,441
you if don't, I would completely understand, okay?
Thank you!
