1
00:00:02,484 --> 00:00:08,070
hi, so it is time for another super, big moment

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,820
in our life of learning to program the computer

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,324
and in fact this may very well be

4
00:00:14,324 --> 00:00:15,929
the biggest moment of all the moments

5
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:18,140
and i'm sure I'll just say in the next video

6
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:19,427
it's the biggest moment

7
00:00:19,427 --> 00:00:20,235
but right now it really is

8
00:00:20,235 --> 00:00:22,255
because we're going to start talking

9
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:23,796
about conditional statements

10
00:00:23,796 --> 00:00:25,497
and it might not sound like it's the

11
00:00:25,497 --> 00:00:26,366
most super, biggest moment ever

12
00:00:26,366 --> 00:00:27,291
but it really is!

13
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:30,088
let's understand why this is gonna be

14
00:00:30,088 --> 00:00:32,372
such a huge leap forward that we're gonna take

15
00:00:32,372 --> 00:00:35,073
maybe, perhaps you don't remember where

16
00:00:35,073 --> 00:00:37,251
we last left off. where we last left off

17
00:00:37,251 --> 00:00:38,832
we had this nice Processing sketch,

18
00:00:38,832 --> 00:00:40,271
we were learning about variables,

19
00:00:40,271 --> 00:00:41,940
we declared a variable at the top,

20
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,032
we initialized its value to zero,

21
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:47,592
and then we manipulated the value of that variable

22
00:00:47,592 --> 00:00:49,453
by incrementing it every time through draw()

23
00:00:49,453 --> 00:00:51,025
which looped over and over again

24
00:00:51,025 --> 00:00:52,153
and when we run the sketch

25
00:00:52,153 --> 00:00:54,691
we have our circle, and it's going ...

26
00:00:54,691 --> 00:00:56,167
there it is ...

27
00:00:56,167 --> 00:00:59,473
it's going, going, going, it's very, very slowly

28
00:00:59,473 --> 00:01:01,075
so this is like awkward now

29
00:01:01,075 --> 00:01:03,039
but eventually it's gonna get to the end

30
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,351
and it's gonna leave,

31
00:01:04,351 --> 00:01:05,192
and it's not gonna come back.

32
00:01:05,192 --> 00:01:07,244
and that's sad. that's a sad moment

33
00:01:07,244 --> 00:01:10,851
for the circle, for us, the program, 
Processing, everything.

34
00:01:10,851 --> 00:01:14,694
but we will now get over this sad moment

35
00:01:14,694 --> 00:01:16,650
and we're going to add something new to our

36
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:19,286
bag of tricks, or bag of tools, we're going

37
00:01:19,286 --> 00:01:20,661
to be able to say:

38
00:01:20,661 --> 00:01:25,167
if the ball, if the circle reaches the end
of that window

39
00:01:25,167 --> 00:01:27,917
do something else, change colour,

40
00:01:27,917 --> 00:01:30,139
turn around, reset your position back to

41
00:01:30,139 --> 00:01:30,872
somewhere else.

42
00:01:30,872 --> 00:01:35,498
this is what we're going to do in this video take

43
00:01:35,498 --> 00:01:37,070
so we're just gonna get started with this

44
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:40,024
so let's move over here

45
00:01:40,024 --> 00:01:41,979
and let's think about what are the nuts and bolts

46
00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:42,884
of what we're doing

47
00:01:42,884 --> 00:01:45,743
we are writing a new kind of block of code

48
00:01:45,743 --> 00:01:48,472
it is called a 'conditional statement'

49
00:01:48,472 --> 00:01:54,642
I'll write this down: conditional statement

50
00:01:54,642 --> 00:01:56,793
and it is going to look like this

51
00:01:56,793 --> 00:02:02,632
IF ( ... this is the squeaky pen ...

52
00:02:02,632 --> 00:02:04,271
I don't know where the other one is,

53
00:02:04,271 --> 00:02:05,806
can I pause for a second? pause

54
00:02:05,806 --> 00:02:08,953
ok, got a new pen

55
00:02:08,953 --> 00:02:13,844
IF, open parentheses, close parentheses,

56
00:02:13,844 --> 00:02:17,376
open curly bracket, close curly bracket,

57
00:02:17,376 --> 00:02:20,677
some code ... I guess all of these pens squeak 
to some extent

58
00:02:20,677 --> 00:02:24,630
but ... hopefully it's not bothering you like
it's bothering me

59
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,808
ok, enough about the pen!

60
00:02:26,808 --> 00:02:28,001
what do we have here?

61
00:02:28,001 --> 00:02:30,955
IF parentheses, parentheses, something that's

62
00:02:30,955 --> 00:02:32,079
going in the middle here

63
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:34,708
open curly bracket, close curly bracket

64
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:36,512
right, this looks familiar in some ways

65
00:02:36,512 --> 00:02:39,075
this is a block of code. just like we had

66
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:42,519
setup() and draw() , setup() has a

67
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:44,923
beginning and an end with the curly brackets

68
00:02:44,923 --> 00:02:46,367
draw() has a beginning and an end 
with curly brackets

69
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:48,586
but we are now having a block of code

70
00:02:48,586 --> 00:02:52,211
what this block of code means is

71
00:02:52,211 --> 00:02:57,483
IF whatever is in here is TRUE

72
00:02:57,483 --> 00:02:59,853
THEN execute this code

73
00:02:59,853 --> 00:03:01,491
IF NOT then don't execute this code.

74
00:03:01,491 --> 00:03:03,678
so this is the moment where we now

75
00:03:03,678 --> 00:03:06,441
have the ability to add some logic

76
00:03:06,441 --> 00:03:08,911
to our program that let's the program take

77
00:03:08,911 --> 00:03:11,384
a path. it could chose to execute some code

78
00:03:11,384 --> 00:03:13,054
it could draw some stuff on the screen

79
00:03:13,054 --> 00:03:14,702
or it could not draw some stuff on the screen

80
00:03:14,702 --> 00:03:16,590
it could change the values of some variables

81
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,835
or it could not change the values of some variables

82
00:03:18,835 --> 00:03:21,181
so if it is always doing this through draw()

83
00:03:21,181 --> 00:03:22,340
every time through draw()

84
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,629
sometimes it will execute things one way,

85
00:03:23,629 --> 00:03:26,029
sometimes it will execute thing a different way.

86
00:03:26,029 --> 00:03:28,035
this allows our program to path different behaviors

87
00:03:28,035 --> 00:03:28,951
at different moments in time.

88
00:03:28,951 --> 00:03:31,332
so this simple, simple structure

89
00:03:31,332 --> 00:03:34,221
is incredibly powerful and important!

90
00:03:34,221 --> 00:03:37,829
so what I wanna do in this video is really just talk

91
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:39,856
about, obviously there's gonna be a whole set

92
00:03:39,856 --> 00:03:41,386
of videos about conditional statements, we're

93
00:03:41,386 --> 00:03:42,569
gonna look at lots of scenarios,

94
00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:46,331
but what I wanna focus on in this particular video

95
00:03:46,331 --> 00:03:48,985
is really just this question mark.

96
00:03:48,985 --> 00:03:50,380
what goes in there?

97
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,462
and what goes in there is known as

98
00:03:52,462 --> 00:03:59,620
a 'boolean expression'

99
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:04,048
now a boolean expression is an expression

100
00:04:04,048 --> 00:04:06,983
that evaluates to only TRUE or FALSE.

101
00:04:06,983 --> 00:04:11,722
for example I could say 'my name is Francis' and 
that would be false,

102
00:04:11,722 --> 00:04:15,611
or I could say 'I am an extremely nervous person'

103
00:04:15,611 --> 00:04:16,825
and that would be true!

104
00:04:16,825 --> 00:04:20,843
but the thing about it is, thats a little bit ...

105
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:22,614
I should point out that's 
a little bit subjective, you know.

106
00:04:22,614 --> 00:04:24,571
we could, in the english language, we might say

107
00:04:24,571 --> 00:04:28,172
things like 'I'm feeling a little melancholy today'

108
00:04:28,172 --> 00:04:33,466
and that could be sort of true, mostly true 
but not exactly true because I'm only a little bit

109
00:04:33,466 --> 00:04:35,435
I don't know what I'm saying but the point is

110
00:04:35,435 --> 00:04:39,503
the types of boolean expressions 
we're going to write

111
00:04:39,503 --> 00:04:41,428
for our computer program are going to be

112
00:04:41,428 --> 00:04:45,925
distinctly true or false. only one or the other.

113
00:04:45,925 --> 00:04:48,398
no gray area whatsoever.

114
00:04:48,398 --> 00:04:50,323
now there are many ways that we're going

115
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:52,248
to see that we can create a boolean expression

116
00:04:52,248 --> 00:04:54,500
but the simplest way, what's going to be

117
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,880
most useful for us right now to start with is

118
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,634
using something called a 'relational operator'.

119
00:04:59,634 --> 00:05:01,207
so let's make a list

120
00:05:01,207 --> 00:05:07,700
of relational operators. 
what are relational operators?

121
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,297
here's one: > (greater than)

122
00:05:10,297 --> 00:05:14,503
another one is: < (less than)

123
00:05:14,503 --> 00:05:16,173
>= (greater than or equal)

124
00:05:16,173 --> 00:05:17,745
<= (less than or equal)

125
00:05:17,745 --> 00:05:19,640
and I'm gonna list a couple here more

126
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,019
at the bottom that are a little bit goofy

127
00:05:21,019 --> 00:05:24,037
== (two equal signs)

128
00:05:24,037 --> 00:05:27,632
or != (not equals) , exclamation, equal

129
00:05:27,632 --> 00:05:29,371
so one of the things about programming

130
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:32,030
is sometimes syntax can be a little bit cryptic

131
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:34,985
right, if I wanna ask if something is not,

132
00:05:34,985 --> 00:05:38,014
if I wanna test if a value is not equal 
to another value

133
00:05:38,014 --> 00:05:43,202
I need to know that these symbols for that are 
exclamation point, equals.

134
00:05:43,202 --> 00:05:46,676
so we'll see examples of this as we go

135
00:05:46,676 --> 00:05:49,246
I think for right now let's just focus on

136
00:05:49,246 --> 00:05:52,075
these two simple relational operators.

137
00:05:52,075 --> 00:05:53,456
this will get us going.

138
00:05:53,456 --> 00:05:55,700
so let's write some boolean expressions

139
00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:00,706
here is a boolean expression for you:

140
00:06:00,706 --> 00:06:03,565
6 > 5 (six is greater than 5)

141
00:06:03,565 --> 00:06:07,003
this is an expression that evaluates to 
'true' or 'false'

142
00:06:07,003 --> 00:06:10,433
is this a true statement or 
is is a false statement?

143
00:06:10,433 --> 00:06:15,893
that is definitely, most definitively true

144
00:06:15,893 --> 00:06:17,404
here is another one:

145
00:06:17,404 --> 00:06:23,855
717 < -10 , is that true or is that false?

146
00:06:23,855 --> 00:06:26,779
that's quite obviously false, right?

147
00:06:26,779 --> 00:06:27,653
there is no way for this expression to be

148
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:31,372
something other than true or false,

149
00:06:31,372 --> 00:06:34,036
even if I say 7 is greater than 7

150
00:06:34,036 --> 00:06:35,993
is that true or false?

151
00:06:35,993 --> 00:06:37,183
that is false!

152
00:06:37,183 --> 00:06:39,984
so we can see: these are the types

153
00:06:39,984 --> 00:06:42,274
of boolean expressions that we can write

154
00:06:42,274 --> 00:06:45,150
with these relational operators.

155
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:47,488
is one value greater than another value?

156
00:06:47,488 --> 00:06:49,029
is one value less than another value?

157
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:51,636
etc

158
00:06:51,636 --> 00:06:54,036
so, these boolean expressions,

159
00:06:54,036 --> 00:06:55,868
these relational operators,

160
00:06:55,868 --> 00:06:57,188
that must mean they go in between

161
00:06:57,188 --> 00:06:58,864
the parentheses right here because this

162
00:06:58,864 --> 00:07:00,949
is where you put your boolean expressions.

163
00:07:00,949 --> 00:07:05,122
if 6 is greater than 5 then execute that code

164
00:07:05,122 --> 00:07:09,877
if this expression evaluates to 'true' 
then execute this code

165
00:07:09,877 --> 00:07:13,731
if this expression evaluates to 'false'
then skip and keep going,

166
00:07:13,731 --> 00:07:14,686
don't evaluate that code!

167
00:07:14,686 --> 00:07:17,996
so now let's look at this and think to ourselves:

168
00:07:17,996 --> 00:07:21,428
does it make any sense at all in any universe

169
00:07:21,428 --> 00:07:23,266
to write that code?

170
00:07:23,266 --> 00:07:25,478
think about that for a second.

171
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:28,469
I argue, I'm gonna make the argument

172
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:30,523
right now that this, while it's syntactically correct,

173
00:07:30,523 --> 00:07:35,399
it has no logical value, right? because 6 > 5 can

174
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:38,134
never ever be anything but true, so there is no

175
00:07:38,134 --> 00:07:39,323
point in having this conditional statement

176
00:07:39,323 --> 00:07:40,704
cause we're always gonna execute that code

177
00:07:40,704 --> 00:07:44,305
so point of writing these boolean expressions

178
00:07:44,305 --> 00:07:46,741
is not to use hardcoded numbers but to use

179
00:07:46,741 --> 00:07:50,055
variables, variables which have variable values

180
00:07:50,055 --> 00:07:52,915
sometimes the value of that value might be

181
00:07:52,915 --> 00:07:54,806
greater than 5, sometimes it might not be

182
00:07:54,806 --> 00:07:57,573
greater than 5. for example, what if I were to say

183
00:07:57,573 --> 00:08:04,372
'if mouseX < 5' ? so if the value of the mouseX,

184
00:08:04,372 --> 00:08:07,168
if the value of the mouse's x-position is greater

185
00:08:07,168 --> 00:08:09,101
than 5 then execute that code.

186
00:08:09,101 --> 00:08:10,866
so only when I have my mouse over here

187
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:12,278
execute that code, if I don't have my mouse

188
00:08:12,278 --> 00:08:13,796
over there then execute some other code.

189
00:08:13,796 --> 00:08:16,127
think about it like if you need to program a rollover

190
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:19,443
from scratch, right? you have this rectangle

191
00:08:19,443 --> 00:08:21,046
on the screen and whenever the mouse is over

192
00:08:21,046 --> 00:08:22,559
that rectangle you want it to light up and change

193
00:08:22,559 --> 00:08:24,513
color, that's how you're gonna do it.

194
00:08:24,513 --> 00:08:26,798
if the mouseX is greater than here,

195
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:27,797
and if it's less than here

196
00:08:27,797 --> 00:08:28,721
and mouseY is greater than here,

197
00:08:28,721 --> 00:08:29,529
and if it's less than here,

198
00:08:29,529 --> 00:08:30,879
if it's within all these bounds

199
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:31,547
then draw a different color

200
00:08:31,547 --> 00:08:34,374
this is where we're going with this type of stuff

201
00:08:34,374 --> 00:08:38,870
ok, so, I think this kinda gives us the pieces,

202
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:41,349
the beginning pieces, of what the form of a

203
00:08:41,349 --> 00:08:42,763
conditional statement looks like,

204
00:08:42,763 --> 00:08:44,588
what a boolean expression is, what's a

205
00:08:44,588 --> 00:08:47,451
basic boolean expressions are using
relational operators

206
00:08:47,451 --> 00:08:49,978
let's just look at one, tiny little example

207
00:08:49,978 --> 00:08:53,253
in code and then we'll move onto the next video.

208
00:08:53,253 --> 00:09:03,275
so let's put aside our bouncing ball, the program

209
00:09:03,275 --> 00:09:04,630
we're hoping to eventually turn into a

210
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:06,940
bouncing ball sketch, for a moment and

211
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,282
let's do something quite simple:

212
00:09:08,282 --> 00:09:10,635
so here we have a Processing sketch that does nothing

213
00:09:10,635 --> 00:09:11,939
but draw a gray background.

214
00:09:11,939 --> 00:09:13,384
size(), and background() in draw()

215
00:09:13,384 --> 00:09:15,317
let's add some new code in here!

216
00:09:15,317 --> 00:09:17,272
let's add this conditional statement:

217
00:09:17,272 --> 00:09:27,683
if mouseX is greater than, pick a value, 200,

218
00:09:27,683 --> 00:09:34,808
then I'm gonna say: background, pick a color,

219
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:39,974
any color, green, uh, red, a bit yellowish, whatever

220
00:09:39,974 --> 00:09:41,291
here's another color

221
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:42,481
we're gonna run this sketch

222
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:45,246
look, gray background, look there's a line of code

223
00:09:45,246 --> 00:09:47,689
in there background some other color,

224
00:09:47,689 --> 00:09:48,966
but we're not seeing that!

225
00:09:48,966 --> 00:09:49,698
it is not happening.

226
00:09:49,698 --> 00:09:51,920
why? because mouseX is currently not greater

227
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,877
than 200. what is the value of mouseX?

228
00:09:53,877 --> 00:09:56,833
I don't know, maybe it's about 20, 30, ...

229
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,953
it's an exciting moment, it's about to happen

230
00:09:58,953 --> 00:10:01,269
50,100, 150, .. ah! there it is! it's orange.

231
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:02,771
that's a nice color, I like orange.

232
00:10:02,771 --> 00:10:04,833
so you can see: wooh, it's not, wooh

233
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:07,494
so we can see pixel 200 is right about there

234
00:10:07,494 --> 00:10:09,513
and we could be a little bit better about this

235
00:10:09,513 --> 00:10:11,310
we could do something like, say,

236
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:18,569
stroke(255); draw a line at pixel 200, 0, ...

237
00:10:18,569 --> 00:10:21,074
so that I could at least see that hey, whenever

238
00:10:21,074 --> 00:10:23,287
the mouse is on this side it's grey, whenever

239
00:10:23,287 --> 00:10:24,677
the mouse is on this side it's orange.

240
00:10:24,677 --> 00:10:27,846
so, you know, this is like quite possibly

241
00:10:27,846 --> 00:10:30,705
the most simple, a very, very, very simple

242
00:10:30,705 --> 00:10:36,491
beginning of conditionals but I would venture to say

243
00:10:36,491 --> 00:10:39,764
for a moment that one of the amazing things 
about programming

244
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:43,240
is all you really need is data, variables

245
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,804
and conditionals to make different choices

246
00:10:45,804 --> 00:10:47,406
we're gonna look at lots of stuff

247
00:10:47,406 --> 00:10:49,714
loops, and functions, and objects and all

248
00:10:49,714 --> 00:10:51,255
sorts of other fundamentals of computation

249
00:10:51,255 --> 00:10:54,363
but I would suggest that even with just the ...

250
00:10:54,363 --> 00:10:58,798
I've just shown you so far, 
that you can have variables

251
00:10:58,798 --> 00:10:59,635
and you can have conditional statement,

252
00:10:59,635 --> 00:11:01,042
there's nothing you could not program right now.

253
00:11:01,042 --> 00:11:02,032
nothing! everything else is just gonna be

254
00:11:02,032 --> 00:11:03,349
about helping making your code shorter,

255
00:11:03,349 --> 00:11:04,985
more organized, more efficient, obviously you

256
00:11:04,985 --> 00:11:07,844
really wanna have a loop, otherwise you will have

257
00:11:07,844 --> 00:11:09,440
to have thousands of lines of code, but

258
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,976
really this is sort of an important moment

259
00:11:11,976 --> 00:11:14,031
to realize that you now have all the tools

260
00:11:14,031 --> 00:11:15,775
to make anything you can imagine!

261
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:17,470
so you should really start giving this a try!

262
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:19,304
so if you're looking for a little exercise

263
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:22,707
to try before you get to the next video,

264
00:11:22,707 --> 00:11:24,820
what I would suggest now is think about

265
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,488
this program: could you write a conditional

266
00:11:27,488 --> 00:11:30,410
statement that executes this task:

267
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:34,938
if the circle reaches the right-hand edge of the

268
00:11:34,938 --> 00:11:38,604
window, reset its location back to the left-hand edge.

269
00:11:38,604 --> 00:11:42,387
now I stated that in a very english language kind

270
00:11:42,387 --> 00:11:45,280
of way, I could state it more like code, more like

271
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,949
pseudo-code, more like code, and eventually

272
00:11:46,949 --> 00:11:48,840
write the code for it. but think about that,

273
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,052
where would you put that conditional statement?

274
00:11:51,052 --> 00:11:52,150
can you get that to work?

275
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:54,459
a very simple exercise, and we'll move on

276
00:11:54,459 --> 00:11:56,067
in the next video and do more with this stuff.

277
00:11:56,067 --> 00:12:00,722
ok, ... I wanted to say something profound

278
00:12:00,722 --> 00:12:03,741
at the end but there is nothing profound other than

279
00:12:03,741 --> 00:12:06,796
I am staring into the abyss of an empty camera

280
00:12:06,796 --> 00:12:09,139
and I bid you adieu!
