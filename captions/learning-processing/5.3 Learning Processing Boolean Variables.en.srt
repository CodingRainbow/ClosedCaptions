1
00:00:02,028 --> 00:00:04,396
hi, so by now if you're here

2
00:00:04,396 --> 00:00:07,457
you've probably watched some videos 
about variables

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:10,170
and some videos about conditional statements

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:15,065
in this video we are going to somehow combine 
those two in an interesting new way

5
00:00:15,065 --> 00:00:16,034
and we're going to look at

6
00:00:16,034 --> 00:00:18,357
what it means to have a variable of type boolean,
right?

7
00:00:18,357 --> 00:00:22,023
what is a variable? 
a variable is a type like an integer,

8
00:00:22,023 --> 00:00:26,314
it is a name, like we might make up the name 'x',

9
00:00:26,314 --> 00:00:28,044
and we might give it an initial value

10
00:00:28,044 --> 00:00:30,981
so this is a totally reasonable variable:

11
00:00:30,981 --> 00:00:33,512
the integer x, that you can't exactly see

12
00:00:33,512 --> 00:00:35,957
cause [inintelligible]

13
00:00:35,957 --> 00:00:37,461
x equals 100

14
00:00:37,461 --> 00:00:41,126
let's, this is crazy, I'm totally 
out of sync here

15
00:00:41,126 --> 00:00:43,853
but let's make a variable now that has

16
00:00:43,853 --> 00:00:50,874
a type boolean, 'going' equals false

17
00:00:50,874 --> 00:00:53,521
this is the type of the variable

18
00:00:53,521 --> 00:00:55,812
it is not a number, it is not a string,

19
00:00:55,812 --> 00:00:58,164
it is not other types of variables,

20
00:00:58,164 --> 00:01:00,041
that you may or may not have learned about,

21
00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:02,520
it is a boolean. that means it only has one

22
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,393
possible, two possible values: true or false

23
00:01:05,393 --> 00:01:07,301
you could use an integer in many ways

24
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:11,444
and have the integer either be 0, for false,
or 1, for true

25
00:01:11,444 --> 00:01:13,476
but there are many other numbers

26
00:01:13,476 --> 00:01:15,144
that piece of data could be

27
00:01:15,144 --> 00:01:18,144
in this case the piece of data can only 
be false or true

28
00:01:18,144 --> 00:01:20,433
and if you remember, a conditional statement

29
00:01:22,623 --> 00:01:29,956
is an expression : if, some expression, evaluates
to true, execute some code

30
00:01:29,956 --> 00:01:33,653
guess what? a boolean variable evaluates

31
00:01:33,653 --> 00:01:35,777
to true or false, right?

32
00:01:35,777 --> 00:01:41,327
this boolean 'going' is false, so 'if going', 
meaning it's not, we're not going to

33
00:01:41,327 --> 00:01:43,203
execute this code because 'going' is false.

34
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:47,223
but if I change its value to true

35
00:01:47,223 --> 00:01:49,608
then this code will become executed.

36
00:01:49,608 --> 00:01:53,306
so, let's look at a way that we might
use this in an example.

37
00:01:55,596 --> 00:01:57,972
here is a very simple example,

38
00:01:57,972 --> 00:02:00,387
it has a circle moving across the screen

39
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:03,616
size(), background(), an ellipse drawing at x,

40
00:02:03,616 --> 00:02:09,022
x = x+2. what if I don't want this circle to start

41
00:02:09,022 --> 00:02:10,939
until I click the mouse?

42
00:02:10,939 --> 00:02:12,844
well, you might think I would do something like

43
00:02:12,844 --> 00:02:18,741
ah, if mousePressed and then run this

44
00:02:18,741 --> 00:02:20,427
and now, ah, the circle is not moving

45
00:02:20,427 --> 00:02:22,458
if I click the mouse it is moving

46
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:23,947
if I let go of the mouse it stopped

47
00:02:23,947 --> 00:02:25,689
but what if I just want the event

48
00:02:25,689 --> 00:02:27,353
of clicking the mouse to trigger the circle

49
00:02:27,353 --> 00:02:30,677
to move from now on and forever 
going forward?

50
00:02:30,677 --> 00:02:33,876
so, to do that, what if I made up my own variable

51
00:02:33,876 --> 00:02:35,572
like 'going'?

52
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:39,572
and we say: boolean going equals false

53
00:02:39,572 --> 00:02:41,061
and run this code

54
00:02:41,061 --> 00:02:42,280
it's not moving!

55
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,715
now if I change the value of 'going' to true

56
00:02:45,715 --> 00:02:48,383
it's moving, because 'going' is true,

57
00:02:48,383 --> 00:02:49,707
so this code is being executed.

58
00:02:49,707 --> 00:02:53,372
so now all you need to do 
is change the value of 'going'

59
00:02:53,372 --> 00:02:56,466
from false to true the moment that I want
the circle start moving

60
00:02:56,466 --> 00:02:57,966
when I click the mouse.

61
00:02:57,966 --> 00:02:59,873
so in this case right here

62
00:02:59,873 --> 00:03:05,101
let's start with 'going' as false, and then when
in mousePressed, this is an event

63
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:07,278
that's triggered as soon as the user clicks
the mouse

64
00:03:07,278 --> 00:03:13,213
let's set: going = true, and it bothers me that 
you can't see all of the code here

65
00:03:13,213 --> 00:03:16,442
so I'm just gonna make this fit here.

66
00:03:16,442 --> 00:03:18,828
now we can see: ok, going is false

67
00:03:18,828 --> 00:03:22,753
so when we run it, it's not moving

68
00:03:22,753 --> 00:03:24,723
it's not moving because going is false

69
00:03:24,723 --> 00:03:26,106
but now when I click the mouse

70
00:03:27,626 --> 00:03:29,276
going becomes true
and it moves.

71
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:30,515
ah, I'm gonna stop it!
click the mouse!

72
00:03:30,515 --> 00:03:33,899
ah, no matter what, when I click the mouse
now going is true

73
00:03:33,899 --> 00:03:36,294
what if want going to become false?

74
00:03:37,874 --> 00:03:39,325
here's a neat little trick:

75
00:03:44,615 --> 00:03:45,846
we have time for this,

76
00:03:45,846 --> 00:03:48,709
you have time for this, 
I have somewhere I need to be

77
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:50,252
but I'm making this video anyway

78
00:03:50,252 --> 00:03:59,562
so, in mousePressed we are saying: 
going equals true

79
00:03:59,562 --> 00:04:02,918
but what if I want going to only become true

80
00:04:02,918 --> 00:04:07,157
if it wasn't true, and if going was already true
I want going now to be false

81
00:04:08,027 --> 00:04:09,241
in other words I want to say:

82
00:04:09,241 --> 00:04:17,634
if going ... then going equals false, right?

83
00:04:17,634 --> 00:04:21,488
if going is true then set going equal to false,

84
00:04:21,488 --> 00:04:26,784
otherwise set going equal to true

85
00:04:26,784 --> 00:04:31,352
so: if going is true, set going to false

86
00:04:31,352 --> 00:04:33,611
otherwise, if going is false, 
set it equal to true.

87
00:04:33,611 --> 00:04:34,705
let's go implement that!

88
00:04:35,835 --> 00:04:38,873
ok, so I'm down here, and I'm going
to implement this.

89
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:46,224
if going, and by the way, you could have written it
like this: if going == true

90
00:04:47,824 --> 00:04:51,049
but that's really long-winded,
going is just true or false,

91
00:04:51,049 --> 00:04:53,975
and a boolean expression evaluates to 
true or false

92
00:04:53,975 --> 00:04:56,779
so I can really just say: if (going == true)
I can just say if (going)

93
00:04:56,779 --> 00:04:58,860
by the way, if (going == false) 
is the same as saying: if (!going)

94
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:09,483
that exclamation point is NOT, is not going,
my ... a little bigger here

95
00:05:09,483 --> 00:05:13,941
hopefully you can read this.

96
00:05:13,941 --> 00:05:21,035
ok, so remember: if it's going then 
going should be false

97
00:05:21,035 --> 00:05:24,086
otherwise let's say going is true

98
00:05:24,086 --> 00:05:25,649
let's run this now, right?

99
00:05:25,649 --> 00:05:28,439
so going is false right now, so when I click 
the mouse

100
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:33,397
[inintelligible]

101
00:05:33,397 --> 00:05:36,625
now if I click the mouse again,
going is true, ah, going is set to false

102
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:38,687
oh, what a magical thing just happened!

103
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:40,657
ready? start ... stop ... start ... stop

104
00:05:40,657 --> 00:05:42,031
oh, it's gonna leave the screen.

105
00:05:42,031 --> 00:05:45,125
ok, but, maybe you thought this was all

106
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:46,478
there's one more piece of this,

107
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:50,584
this is fine and good and perfectly reasonable

108
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:53,240
it is rather long-winded

109
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:58,604
we as programmers, sometimes our whole life
is just trying to make things shorter,

110
00:05:58,604 --> 00:06:00,041
although that's not really any point of that,

111
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:01,103
you might also just make things longer,

112
00:06:01,103 --> 00:06:03,592
it's good for things to be clear, readable, 
but anyway,

113
00:06:03,592 --> 00:06:04,925
if we want to make this shorter,

114
00:06:06,845 --> 00:06:08,944
let's examine this statement

115
00:06:08,944 --> 00:06:12,238
going = ! going ;

116
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:15,737
this seems like it must be some sort of 
illegal code

117
00:06:15,737 --> 00:06:17,028
that you could not possibly write

118
00:06:17,028 --> 00:06:19,288
and it's self-referential and circular in some way

119
00:06:19,288 --> 00:06:20,725
it's not gonna work, but in fact

120
00:06:20,725 --> 00:06:24,100
this is exactly what we want in this particular case

121
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:27,579
let's think about this again

122
00:06:27,579 --> 00:06:30,548
let's say x = y + z

123
00:06:30,548 --> 00:06:32,444
if we have a statement like this,

124
00:06:32,444 --> 00:06:35,505
remember we evaluate this side of the equation

125
00:06:35,505 --> 00:06:37,860
and store the result over here

126
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,234
so we're going to do the same thing here

127
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:41,963
we evaluate this side of the equation

128
00:06:41,963 --> 00:06:43,193
and store the result here

129
00:06:43,193 --> 00:06:45,378
it's kind of like how, when you say

130
00:06:45,378 --> 00:06:47,952
x = x + 1 , this seems a little strange

131
00:06:47,952 --> 00:06:49,952
it equals itself plus 1?

132
00:06:49,952 --> 00:06:52,681
but it's not big deal, 
if it were 5 then 5+1=6

133
00:06:52,681 --> 00:06:54,628
and now x equals to 6, 
this is an operation

134
00:06:54,628 --> 00:06:56,691
that increments x over and over again

135
00:06:56,691 --> 00:07:00,856
5 becomes 6 becomes 7,
I'm talking way too fast in this video,

136
00:07:00,856 --> 00:07:05,376
but here, let's say going is true

137
00:07:06,806 --> 00:07:10,252
what is not true? 
not true is false

138
00:07:10,252 --> 00:07:15,896
let's say going is false,
what is not false? true!

139
00:07:15,896 --> 00:07:21,886
so going equals not itself
just takes the value of going,

140
00:07:21,886 --> 00:07:26,053
if it's true it turns it into false,
if it's false it turns it into true!

141
00:07:26,053 --> 00:07:27,886
that might give you a little bit of a headache

142
00:07:27,886 --> 00:07:29,740
but I think that as you start to think about it

143
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,374
and write it down and think about it again

144
00:07:31,374 --> 00:07:32,875
it will start to make more and more sense

145
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:37,407
so let's go back over here and let's
look at what he can write here now

146
00:07:37,407 --> 00:07:40,893
going equals not going, ok?

147
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:43,332
going is currently false, 
so as soon as I click the mouse

148
00:07:43,332 --> 00:07:46,247
going is going to equal not false, 
which is true

149
00:07:46,247 --> 00:07:50,113
and when I click the mouse again,
going is going to equal not true

150
00:07:50,113 --> 00:07:51,081
which is false.

151
00:07:51,081 --> 00:07:53,561
so this is just a little bit of an inkling

152
00:07:53,561 --> 00:07:55,060
of what it means to use a variable

153
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,560
with a type of boolean

154
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,893
it's just a little bit of a helper, 
it's kind of like we can store

155
00:08:00,893 --> 00:08:03,777
the value of a switch in our program

156
00:08:03,777 --> 00:08:06,601
we can always know is that switch on
or is that switch off?

157
00:08:06,601 --> 00:08:08,912
and at any point we could act 
upon that

158
00:08:08,912 --> 00:08:11,570
if the switch is on, do this code,
if it's off do this other code.

159
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:14,028
and we can also change the value of that switch

160
00:08:14,028 --> 00:08:17,527
by turning it on, setting it to true,
or turning it off, setting it to false.

161
00:08:17,527 --> 00:08:21,015
usually at the end of these videos
I give some sort of exercise

162
00:08:21,015 --> 00:08:22,348
but I can't think of one right now

163
00:08:22,348 --> 00:08:25,657
but what you might do is find some 
program that you wrote

164
00:08:25,657 --> 00:08:30,598
and see where you might store
a value of true or false

165
00:08:30,598 --> 00:08:35,504
and act upon that. that could be something
that you could do.

166
00:08:35,504 --> 00:08:37,646
I'll think of something better later!

167
00:08:37,646 --> 00:08:38,764
maybe put it in the notes

168
00:08:38,764 --> 00:08:40,763
ok, I'm gonna stop this video

169
00:08:40,763 --> 00:08:42,616
and you're going to enjoy the rest of your day

170
00:08:42,616 --> 00:08:45,179
I'm over here and I'm going now.

171
00:08:45,179 --> 00:08:46,314
my going is true!

172
00:08:46,314 --> 00:08:46,752
ok, bye
