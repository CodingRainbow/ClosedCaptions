1
00:00:00,895 --> 00:00:03,445
ok so where where where is your head at

2
00:00:03,445 --> 00:00:06,081
I'm not really sure but maybe now you have a
sense of

3
00:00:06,081 --> 00:00:08,027
okay I kinda get what programming is

4
00:00:08,027 --> 00:00:11,362
I've gotta write instructions with a
specific syntax

5
00:00:11,362 --> 00:00:14,630
and I could choose all these different
languages and all these different

6
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:15,962
environments for different kinds of
applications and

7
00:00:15,962 --> 00:00:19,608
for different operating system and for
different hardware but here

8
00:00:19,608 --> 00:00:24,368
we're going to use Processing. what
advantages does

9
00:00:24,368 --> 00:00:28,793
processing give us what kinds of things
can we make with processing what is the

10
00:00:28,793 --> 00:00:30,740
lens that we're gonna look through

11
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,439
to learn the fundamental concepts a
programming this is key

12
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:36,666
we're not I'm not it's not my intention
here for you

13
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:40,458
to learn processing it's my intention
for you to learn

14
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:45,282
the fundamental tools of computation
we're going to use processing as the

15
00:00:45,282 --> 00:00:46,916
environment to learn those tools

16
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:49,676
but those tools those concepts will go
across

17
00:00:49,676 --> 00:00:52,999
any programming language environment
that you choose to use in the future

18
00:00:52,999 --> 00:00:56,790
so why- as I said processing we- it's a thing
we download

19
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:00,219
we can open it- one of the first things
you might do yourself

20
00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:03,445
and I'll kinda do this for you is take a
look through the examples

21
00:01:03,445 --> 00:01:06,296
so you can see here there's a little
window that you can pop up

22
00:01:06,296 --> 00:01:07,299
that has examples

23
00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:10,673
and you can kinda look through look
these basics and some of these basic things

24
00:01:10,673 --> 00:01:11,828
will give you a sense of

25
00:01:11,828 --> 00:01:15,662
what is processing doing. you can learn about
color, you can learn about form,

26
00:01:15,662 --> 00:01:16,902
you can learn about math

27
00:01:16,902 --> 00:01:20,902
so if for example I just go here and
lets say we wanna learn about hue

28
00:01:20,902 --> 00:01:24,245
with processing I can run this
particular example

29
00:01:24,245 --> 00:01:27,694
and you can see that what it's doing
here is as I move the mouse back and

30
00:01:27,694 --> 00:01:28,890
forth across the screen

31
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,347
its changing the hue of the color that
I'm drawing

32
00:01:32,347 --> 00:01:37,942
so there's a range of examples and you'll
notice these examples, generally speaking

33
00:01:37,942 --> 00:01:40,959
have a visual design component so

34
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:43,920
if you're interested in design, animation,

35
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,640
images, creative applications of
software,

36
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,084
processing is a good environment to
explore ideas in that area

37
00:01:51,084 --> 00:01:54,668
Umm another thing and I'm just
gonna kinda give you a quick range

38
00:01:54,668 --> 00:01:58,334
as you look through you might start to
look through a lot the examples

39
00:01:58,334 --> 00:01:59,302
under topics:

40
00:01:59,302 --> 00:02:03,657
and one of the ones that's sure dear to
my heart that you might look at is OK

41
00:02:03,657 --> 00:02:07,415
simulate so there's a lot of nice
examples we can look at

42
00:02:07,415 --> 00:02:10,905
this idea on what- of simulating

43
00:02:10,905 --> 00:02:14,500
physics elements through processing 
you can see there are some circles on the screen

44
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,372
as I click them and move them 
with the mouse

45
00:02:16,372 --> 00:02:18,716
- my head is always- clearly this is very poorly

46
00:02:18,716 --> 00:02:22,044
what I'm doing here. Umm they there they
have this

47
00:02:22,044 --> 00:02:25,602
spring-like motion so one of the nice
things about processing is there's a-

48
00:02:25,602 --> 00:02:29,174
when you downloaded it, there's a wide range
examples and to get a sense of

49
00:02:29,174 --> 00:02:32,662
what can I do, what are some ideas of
things I might try to make: you could

50
00:02:32,662 --> 00:02:34,693
you could spend a whole day just
clicking through

51
00:02:34,693 --> 00:02:36,224
and running all of the examples

52
00:02:36,224 --> 00:02:39,954
Umm the other thing that I would just
mention is that processing

53
00:02:39,954 --> 00:02:44,404
has a in addition to the sort of 2d drawing
engine which allows you to draw

54
00:02:44,404 --> 00:02:47,599
simple and and kinda complex shapes and
animations in 2d

55
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,890
you can do a lot of stuff in three
dimensions as well

56
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:54,524
I guess I'll just open up this one
called Planets

57
00:02:54,524 --> 00:02:59,702
and we can see here's a nice- Whoo this is
beautiful! I'm going to have to use this

58
00:02:59,702 --> 00:03:00,701
for something,

59
00:03:00,701 --> 00:03:03,273
but here we can see, err this err, nice

60
00:03:03,273 --> 00:03:07,222
little demonstration of how you can do
3d rendering in processing as well

61
00:03:07,222 --> 00:03:08,356
err

62
00:03:08,356 --> 00:03:15,179
and you can see, you can do, all sorts of different 
kinds of camera stuff, lighting stuff, textures:

63
00:03:15,179 --> 00:03:18,002
all things that you might find in a 
3D computer graphics environment

64
00:03:18,002 --> 00:03:19,782
that' what you can do

65
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:22,136
and you can do with the processing
environment as well so

66
00:03:22,136 --> 00:03:24,593
this is- I just closed everything

67
00:03:24,593 --> 00:03:29,979
that is the examples- the other thing, it's
just something else I really want to

68
00:03:29,979 --> 00:03:31,155
mention about processing

69
00:03:31,155 --> 00:03:35,498
so okay so here's something I kinda should
have might have wanted to mention,

70
00:03:35,498 --> 00:03:36,176
we have this

71
00:03:36,176 --> 00:03:41,082
a show like crazy list of all these
programming languages that I was kinda

72
00:03:41,082 --> 00:03:42,016
saying aaah,

73
00:03:42,016 --> 00:03:45,716
okay, so here we're using processing and
one thing you might think it's like

74
00:03:45,716 --> 00:03:46,445
oh is it just

75
00:03:46,445 --> 00:03:50,861
processing, it like this toy environment
that I can kind of just do a little like experimental

76
00:03:50,861 --> 00:03:52,328
ideas in buit can't really make

77
00:03:52,328 --> 00:03:57,382
a a large-scale projects with; so one of
the things that I like about processing is

78
00:03:57,382 --> 00:03:59,173
both its ability to allow you to

79
00:03:59,173 --> 00:04:02,808
get started very quickly and learn the
basics but also you can build fairly

80
00:04:02,808 --> 00:04:05,245
large scale sophisticated projects in it

81
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:09,202
and one of the reasons for this is, is that you
aren't learning the processing language-

82
00:04:09,202 --> 00:04:10,619
yes you're using the oppressing environment

83
00:04:10,619 --> 00:04:14,222
yes there is a a set of processing
functions

84
00:04:14,222 --> 00:04:18,222
that are that are that are needed for
processing itself but really the language a

85
00:04:18,222 --> 00:04:19,513
that you're writing

86
00:04:19,513 --> 00:04:23,242
code in is Java, now Java is probably about right
now, and I refer to the era that we live in,

87
00:04:23,242 --> 00:04:27,293
2013, it's probably like the least cool
thing you can learn like

88
00:04:27,293 --> 00:04:31,585
it's much cooler to learn JavaScript or
ruby and and there's lots of great stuff

89
00:04:31,585 --> 00:04:32,617
you can do; i mean

90
00:04:32,617 --> 00:04:36,573
javascript is especially on the web
now and, erm canvas and webGL

91
00:04:36,573 --> 00:04:39,897
all this amazing stuff that I also encourage
you to learn but

92
00:04:39,897 --> 00:04:45,094
there is an advantage to using Java or
the fact that processing is built on top of

93
00:04:45,094 --> 00:04:46,782
Java, er, you know Java is kinda

94
00:04:46,782 --> 00:04:50,207
in many ways I i've heard this said
about Java err

95
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:53,239
something silly, but, it's not the best

96
00:04:53,239 --> 00:04:56,531
language for anything but it does

97
00:04:56,531 --> 00:05:00,343
everything, so if there's anything you're
thinking about doing,

98
00:05:00,343 --> 00:05:02,248
if you are you wanna like read your email

99
00:05:02,248 --> 00:05:05,011
into your processing program and
then draw little bubbles on the screen

100
00:05:05,011 --> 00:05:06,432
for every email you've received

101
00:05:06,432 --> 00:05:09,623
or you want to connect to the Microsoft
Kinect

102
00:05:09,623 --> 00:05:12,454
or you want to use err this physical
piece of this hardware

103
00:05:12,454 --> 00:05:14,113
you want to use the sensor

104
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:19,234
erm, you can really do just about anything
you'll find a java library out there

105
00:05:19,234 --> 00:05:22,378
for just about anything so processing
because it's built on Java

106
00:05:22,378 --> 00:05:26,285
is incredibly extendable through
libraries

107
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:30,964
now what are these libraries and you can
see I'm into

108
00:05:30,964 --> 00:05:34,481
if I go back to that examples window erm,

109
00:05:34,481 --> 00:05:37,876
looking through those examples topics I could go 
down to start to look at

110
00:05:37,876 --> 00:05:40,085
you want to use the libraries

111
00:05:40,085 --> 00:05:42,001
one which i'll just demonstrate really
briefly to you right now is video

112
00:05:42,001 --> 00:05:45,895
so under capturei'm gonna look at er, one of these

113
00:05:45,895 --> 00:05:49,747
examples; gonna run this mirror example

114
00:05:49,747 --> 00:05:53,271
and I think this will work

115
00:05:53,271 --> 00:05:56,727
err, its effect we should edit

116
00:05:56,727 --> 00:06:00,342
it's taking a minute or so here we can
see a look what's interesting is this is

117
00:06:00,342 --> 00:06:02,893
a green screen so you can see the green
wall in the actual camera

118
00:06:02,893 --> 00:06:07,425
so the camera here is reading my image
so processing can connect to pieces of

119
00:06:07,425 --> 00:06:09,539
hardware through libraries, can connect to
your camera

120
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:13,945
and what this example is doing is it's
taking every single pixel from a regular

121
00:06:13,945 --> 00:06:15,588
good old-fashioned image

122
00:06:15,588 --> 00:06:17,965
and instead of drawing that pixel as a

123
00:06:17,965 --> 00:06:23,350
a a- drawing that pixel as a rectangle on
the screen rotated according to the

124
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:24,901
brightness or something

125
00:06:24,901 --> 00:06:28,715
so you can see that we can create this
abstract visualization of the data

126
00:06:28,715 --> 00:06:32,631
the color data that's coming in from a
camera this is, err, something we'll

127
00:06:32,631 --> 00:06:33,859
explore in great detail

128
00:06:33,859 --> 00:06:38,576
in a future video how to write these
kinda examples how to capture images

129
00:06:38,576 --> 00:06:42,044
how to read pixels, how to draw stuff based on
those pixels; so

130
00:06:42,044 --> 00:06:46,242
be- the video library is something that
comes with processing when you download it

131
00:06:46,242 --> 00:06:50,825
but processing itself has a huge, has a
large community of people making

132
00:06:50,825 --> 00:06:54,117
libraries and I downloaded one an
arbitrary one

133
00:06:54,117 --> 00:06:57,744
called the Yahoo weather library we can
tell, just open up this example

134
00:06:57,744 --> 00:07:01,168
erm, this library allows you to connect

135
00:07:01,168 --> 00:07:04,106
to Yahoo- Yahoo weather data

136
00:07:04,106 --> 00:07:07,835
and you can see here that this processing
sketch

137
00:07:07,835 --> 00:07:11,624
has grabbed the weather information from
the city of berlin, it's fair, the wind

138
00:07:11,624 --> 00:07:12,655
direction is three

139
00:07:12,655 --> 00:07:16,905
10 which must maybe is a err, angle!

140
00:07:16,905 --> 00:07:21,372
and, erm, and the wind speed is a eight
kilometers kilo-

141
00:07:21,372 --> 00:07:24,843
kilometers- I became French, so
kilometers per hour

142
00:07:24,843 --> 00:07:29,216
so you can see then this others these
particles these dots that are drawn on the screen

143
00:07:29,216 --> 00:07:31,313
that are moving according to that wind
direction: so

144
00:07:31,313 --> 00:07:36,134
connecting to data sources there if you
have an idea for something and processing

145
00:07:36,134 --> 00:07:36,755
doesn't do it

146
00:07:36,755 --> 00:07:42,902
if you can write the Java code for that
you can make it into a library and you

147
00:07:42,902 --> 00:07:44,214
can do it in processing so

148
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:47,504
the processing is tremendously extendable
through all sorts of libraries,

149
00:07:47,504 --> 00:07:48,504
if you want to get a sense

150
00:07:48,504 --> 00:07:51,796
up what the available libraries are for
you, er,

151
00:07:51,796 --> 00:07:55,913
if we go back to the processing website
waa- and go to libraries

152
00:07:55,913 --> 00:07:59,607
you can see there is a nice list of tons
and tons

153
00:07:59,607 --> 00:08:03,305
libraries and you can also get them,
which I-I- this is err,

154
00:08:03,305 --> 00:08:08,597
through, err, through this library
manager that comes with

155
00:08:08,597 --> 00:08:12,325
processing software itself so we can go
through this list of

156
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:15,522
libraries and if I want this library
which is

157
00:08:15,522 --> 00:08:18,242
a lightweight library for creating
animations and trans-

158
00:08:18,242 --> 00:08:22,542
transitions I can click Install and it will
install that library I can use it

159
00:08:22,542 --> 00:08:25,864
in my code- okay! so this is kinda

160
00:08:25,864 --> 00:08:29,854
at least a little bit of, erm, me getting
started showing you-

161
00:08:29,854 --> 00:08:33,552
okay! here's the process development
environment. here are

162
00:08:33,552 --> 00:08:37,729
some the examples, here some libraries, here's
the kind of things that can do

163
00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:40,310
and next thing I wanna kinda briefly
look at

164
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:42,082
is just a quick range of some projects

165
00:08:42,082 --> 00:08:45,122
that have been made with processing to
get you thinking about

166
00:08:45,122 --> 00:08:50,402
looking at erm, larger-scale
installations and animations and and

167
00:08:50,402 --> 00:08:51,236
things that people are doing

168
00:08:51,236 --> 00:08:55,287
the first project I'm going to show you
what's called Chronograph by Casey Reas, one of the

169
00:08:55,287 --> 00:08:57,225
creators of processing and

170
00:08:57,225 --> 00:08:59,776
Tal Rosner, I apologize if I've
pronounced the name

171
00:08:59,776 --> 00:09:03,302
here incorrectly, erm, this is a project

172
00:09:03,302 --> 00:09:06,893
which I'll skip to the end
here to just show you this

173
00:09:06,893 --> 00:09:09,879
time-lapse. you can see this is a projection
piece

174
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:13,170
that's projected onto the side of this
building which is

175
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:16,398
New World Center in Miami Florida for
the New World Symphony so

176
00:09:16,398 --> 00:09:19,649
this is the time lapse of the piece
running, this is showing it more quickly but

177
00:09:19,649 --> 00:09:20,702
you can see this idea of

178
00:09:20,702 --> 00:09:23,762
abstract visuals projected on the side
of the building

179
00:09:23,762 --> 00:09:27,584
this is all generative, procedural this is
a piece of software

180
00:09:27,584 --> 00:09:28,812
that generates this content

181
00:09:28,812 --> 00:09:31,817
that's projected on the side of a building,
this is something that's done a lot with

182
00:09:31,817 --> 00:09:35,573
Processing, erm, I, a

183
00:09:35,573 --> 00:09:38,333
I teach a class here at ITP where the
students create work

184
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:39,593
for a large video wall

185
00:09:39,593 --> 00:09:44,011
erm, here are a couple of examples of projects.
there, this is a project called Beluga

186
00:09:44,011 --> 00:09:47,302
I'm skipping the sound but this was a
dance performance and

187
00:09:47,302 --> 00:09:52,904
you can see that there are these dancers
that are moving and jumping on tramp-

188
00:09:52,904 --> 00:09:55,862
trampolines. this a hundred twenty foot
wide video wall, it's about

189
00:09:55,862 --> 00:10:00,122
twelve feet high and the visuals,
regenerative. this

190
00:10:00,122 --> 00:10:04,006
seascape and they responded to the
movement's of these dancers who were

191
00:10:04,006 --> 00:10:05,102
bouncing up and down

192
00:10:05,102 --> 00:10:09,203
on trampolines. so this was actually, er, it's
using processing but there are three

193
00:10:09,203 --> 00:10:11,934
separate computers running three
processing sketches

194
00:10:11,934 --> 00:10:15,288
each controlling a section of the video
wall so even these types of

195
00:10:15,288 --> 00:10:16,757
large-scale 3d

196
00:10:16,757 --> 00:10:20,744
performance graphics for performance are
made with processing; another example

197
00:10:20,744 --> 00:10:24,297
of this for the same space; this is a
project called replica

198
00:10:24,297 --> 00:10:28,152
which here

199
00:10:28,152 --> 00:10:32,075
there was a dancer live in the space
with the camera pointed at her

200
00:10:32,075 --> 00:10:35,174
and her image was then a projected onto
the wall

201
00:10:35,174 --> 00:10:38,915
and manipulated with a bit- series of
different kinds

202
00:10:38,915 --> 00:10:42,325
of time-based effects and there's music,
the dancer

203
00:10:42,325 --> 00:10:46,813
and all happening in real time; all
happening live

204
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:52,042
okay I'm realizing I'm forgetting to mention
people's names but

205
00:10:52,042 --> 00:10:56,333
I will- erm, there'll be links below where you can
find out the- the wonderful people who

206
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:57,947
made some of these projects so

207
00:10:57,947 --> 00:11:01,176
another thing that processing is used a lot
for is for

208
00:11:01,176 --> 00:11:05,467
motion graphics. this is a great project
by Molly Schwartz where she did an animation

209
00:11:05,467 --> 00:11:09,672
about eels; now err, called err, Bellyful of Eels; 
if you look at this a lot of this

210
00:11:09,706 --> 00:11:11,126
is done with After Effects,

211
00:11:11,134 --> 00:11:13,974
err, but here in in in this particular part of
the

212
00:11:13,974 --> 00:11:18,630
the err, animation, these eels that are
actually swimming through this

213
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:23,260
underwater pipe sewer like space; those 
were actually made in processing

214
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,020
rendered out from processing

215
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,780
and incorporated into a larger animation
project and

216
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:31,101
there are lots of wonderful examples
music videos that have been made

217
00:11:31,101 --> 00:11:31,895
with Processing

218
00:11:33,345 --> 00:11:36,851
or different types of elements that
you wouldn't want to

219
00:11:36,851 --> 00:11:40,381
hand animate, that need an algorithmic, generative process to,

220
00:11:40,381 --> 00:11:43,036
whether it's behaviors or repetition,

221
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,973
were done with code, with Processing

222
00:11:45,973 --> 00:11:52,328
okay another, another co-

223
00:11:52,328 --> 00:11:55,618
like popular use of processing is for
data visualization

224
00:11:55,618 --> 00:11:59,283
a I'll show you a well-known project by
Jer Thorpe

225
00:11:59,283 --> 00:12:02,735
This here is a visualization it's grabbing

226
00:12:02,735 --> 00:12:06,952
data from Twitter and looking for people
who said, you know

227
00:12:06,952 --> 00:12:10,496
who are very excited about the fact that-
just landed in Hawaii, for example

228
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:14,927
so anyone who posted 'just landed Hawaii'
if it was me- I wish I would have gone to Hawaii,

229
00:12:14,927 --> 00:12:15,792
I've never been there-

230
00:12:15,792 --> 00:12:19,250
but erm, my home location on Twitter will
be New York

231
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:22,510
Jere - the project parses out

232
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:26,966
the locations New York and Hawaii and the time
that the tweet was posted

233
00:12:26,966 --> 00:12:30,403
and draws a, this kinda arc path from

234
00:12:30,403 --> 00:12:35,580
the original location to the landing location so
its a visualization of people posting on Twitter

235
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:39,080
about their flight and you can see
different views there's this kind of

236
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,581
like horizontal view now

237
00:12:40,581 --> 00:12:43,216
it's spinning around, all this is done through
code

238
00:12:43,216 --> 00:12:46,101
through an algorithmic process to
visualize this data

239
00:12:46,101 --> 00:12:47,359
and you can see kinda

240
00:12:47,359 --> 00:12:49,829
ah, well you can't really see that but
ah,

241
00:12:49,829 --> 00:12:55,006
up here at the top left um this timescale
showing where we are and

242
00:12:55,006 --> 00:13:00,744
this er, ah where we are in time. so this is a
a great use of processing and it looks like oh

243
00:13:00,744 --> 00:13:04,775
my goodness this very like complicated
crazy 3d- how I could ever possibly

244
00:13:04,775 --> 00:13:05,745
learn how to do this;

245
00:13:05,745 --> 00:13:09,951
we're going to start with some very basic
things like how to draw a circle how to

246
00:13:09,951 --> 00:13:10,649
move a circle

247
00:13:10,649 --> 00:13:14,055
this is really just doing that also is
just lots of circles,

248
00:13:14,055 --> 00:13:18,201
a little bit of 3d, the- what's happening with
those circles is controlled by data

249
00:13:18,201 --> 00:13:21,137
so all this stuff is possible through
learning the

250
00:13:21,137 --> 00:13:26,273
foundations of programming and a a
little bit about how to draw- do stuff

251
00:13:26,273 --> 00:13:27,688
with computer graphics as well.

252
00:13:27,688 --> 00:13:32,085
ah, so I'll I'll- this is a great
project by Mary Wong

253
00:13:32,085 --> 00:13:33,812
if you're interested a lot of

254
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:37,312
wonderful work is being done with
processing to create physical so if you

255
00:13:37,312 --> 00:13:38,531
want to print design

256
00:13:38,531 --> 00:13:41,749
I would a checking out the work of Rune Matthiesen
and err,

257
00:13:41,749 --> 00:13:45,040
course he teaches call Printing Code,
there's a tremendous suite of examples of

258
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:45,852
using computation

259
00:13:45,852 --> 00:13:50,061
to generate print designs, err, this is a
project that Mary

260
00:13:50,061 --> 00:13:54,455
Huang made to create a, err, fashion designed

261
00:13:54,455 --> 00:13:58,278
through, through a generative process so you
can see here, the mouse

262
00:13:58,278 --> 00:14:00,050
- this is a Processing sketch running-

263
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:04,248
with the mouse able to draw over the
figure of the human form

264
00:14:04,248 --> 00:14:07,735
and that and that what the mouse is
drawing is that

265
00:14:07,735 --> 00:14:12,395
a mated to geometry, which is used to
generate the,

266
00:14:12,395 --> 00:14:15,464
the design for a dress and Mary actually
created these dresses and

267
00:14:15,464 --> 00:14:18,674
physically fabricated them and wore them
as well and so

268
00:14:18,674 --> 00:14:22,212
a lot of stuff can be is being done
processing in terms of, erm

269
00:14:22,212 --> 00:14:24,453
take a look at the work at nervous
system,

270
00:14:24,453 --> 00:14:26,036
I'll include a link to that as well

271
00:14:26,036 --> 00:14:30,456
for making jewelry designs you can print
stuff- you can generate stuff for a

272
00:14:30,456 --> 00:14:32,619
maker bot with processing to do 3d
printing

273
00:14:32,619 --> 00:14:36,170
this is something that you could
explore a as an application

274
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:37,201
that you might

275
00:14:37,201 --> 00:14:40,335
an idea you might do throughout if
you're following along

276
00:14:40,335 --> 00:14:41,304
with all these videos

277
00:14:41,304 --> 00:14:44,418
also doing- a creating a

278
00:14:44,418 --> 00:14:46,918
a physical computing interfaces; this
is a project

279
00:14:46,918 --> 00:14:50,845
called the mud tub um which

280
00:14:50,845 --> 00:14:54,532
kinda answers that question what's the
thing that you might want to get

281
00:14:54,532 --> 00:14:59,916
least near your computer- a big pile mud,
this is by Tom Gerhard,

282
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:03,542
on and so this is also kind of interesting to
say like

283
00:15:03,542 --> 00:15:08,031
what you're learning here might not might not need

284
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:11,095
to make something that has this really
obvious practical like-

285
00:15:11,095 --> 00:15:14,340
I wanna make an app, and I wanna like sell
billions of them become a

286
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,548
zillionaire which actually is

287
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:19,761
would be nice, but you know anyway
there's more to life than

288
00:15:19,761 --> 00:15:23,088
selling your apps, but err, this you can
see here

289
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:25,932
there's a projection on this tub of mud
which is

290
00:15:25,932 --> 00:15:27,724
the graphics that's being output

291
00:15:27,724 --> 00:15:29,932
is done through processing and
processing is reading

292
00:15:29,932 --> 00:15:34,110
the sensors that are coming back in um
from the mud

293
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:37,368
err, there's actually sensors underneath
the mud that's measuring the weight of the

294
00:15:37,368 --> 00:15:38,212
mud at any

295
00:15:38,212 --> 00:15:42,357
point which allows the the software to
read the topology essentially of the mud

296
00:15:42,357 --> 00:15:45,185
and you can see the mud becomes this
controller where

297
00:15:45,185 --> 00:15:48,879
you with your hands you can kind bounce
this ball around if I

298
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:52,815
kinda skip to the end here you can see you
can kinda play this

299
00:15:52,815 --> 00:15:56,012
game here on a separate screen by
pressing on the mud

300
00:15:56,012 --> 00:15:59,303
so this idea of making your own physical
computing device

301
00:15:59,303 --> 00:16:03,190
your own interface a tub of mud;
another great example of this

302
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:07,324
is err the scrollable project; I'll just
show you err

303
00:16:07,324 --> 00:16:10,552
this is by Filippo Vanucci and you can
see here is his processing

304
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:12,709
ah, shoot!

305
00:16:12,709 --> 00:16:17,073
which I think, here is his processing
sketch which

306
00:16:17,073 --> 00:16:20,552
if you look at it, makes this nice ink
effect

307
00:16:20,552 --> 00:16:23,813
so he's created this a sketch

308
00:16:23,813 --> 00:16:27,833
and if I click around here you can see
it draws a bunch of dots and it makes this

309
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:29,865
animation that has this ink like quality to it

310
00:16:29,865 --> 00:16:34,467
so what did he use this process sketch
for? he used it to project onto paper

311
00:16:34,467 --> 00:16:38,019
and he built sensors to measure how

312
00:16:38,019 --> 00:16:41,893
what that paper's doing. this will become
much more obvious when I show you it in a

313
00:16:41,893 --> 00:16:42,955
project called scrollables.

314
00:16:42,955 --> 00:16:47,715
and you can see these are these devices
that you can scroll the paper and I'll

315
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:48,895
just skip ahead here

316
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:52,895
by scrolling back and forth you can
control and animation so of course we're

317
00:16:52,895 --> 00:16:54,360
all familiar with touchscreens

318
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,590
a but here we had this physical device

319
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:02,113
which has real tactile tangible quality. because
real paper that you're scrolling and you

320
00:17:02,113 --> 00:17:03,672
can see as you scroll back and forth

321
00:17:03,672 --> 00:17:07,063
you can play for example the game pong
and this ink effect was created through

322
00:17:07,063 --> 00:17:09,492
an algorithm in processing and/or a

323
00:17:09,492 --> 00:17:13,023
and control through the physical
interface so

324
00:17:13,023 --> 00:17:19,608
you know this is very very, err, a really
really quick and dirty kind of- I don't

325
00:17:19,608 --> 00:17:20,867
know if I missed anything

326
00:17:20,867 --> 00:17:22,867
key that I wanted to show you really kinda
quick and dirty,

327
00:17:22,867 --> 00:17:24,367
just quick range of projects that

328
00:17:24,367 --> 00:17:26,951
were made in Processing. I would also
encourage you to

329
00:17:26,951 --> 00:17:32,951
on the processing website at

330
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:35,492
to go take a look at the exhibition so
if you look at the exhibition link

331
00:17:35,492 --> 00:17:40,801
there is a ton of projects that you
can see historically you can actually go

332
00:17:40,801 --> 00:17:41,554
it's

333
00:17:41,554 --> 00:17:44,762
and you can actually go all the way back
if on the bottom here

334
00:17:44,762 --> 00:17:48,352
oh boy,

335
00:17:48,352 --> 00:17:51,385
this is getting awkward - at the bottom
here if you click on

336
00:17:51,385 --> 00:17:55,176
number one you can actually see stuff
that was posted for the process exhibition

337
00:17:55,176 --> 00:17:55,768
from

338
00:17:55,768 --> 00:17:56,270
over 10 years ago

339
00:17:56,270 --> 00:18:00,904
so this is there's a if you want to kind
of get a sense that the landscape of

340
00:18:00,904 --> 00:18:04,387
what this processing do what are the
kinds of things that I'm going to learn

341
00:18:04,387 --> 00:18:08,017
you could walk yourself through the examples
you can look at a bunch of projects that

342
00:18:08,017 --> 00:18:09,373
are made with processing but

343
00:18:09,373 --> 00:18:12,862
ultimately the rest of these videos are going
to very

344
00:18:12,862 --> 00:18:17,557
slowly by slowly piece by piece walk you
through the fundamentals of programming

345
00:18:17,557 --> 00:18:21,641
through a whole lot of graphic examples
and processing and that will help you

346
00:18:21,641 --> 00:18:22,192
generate ideas

347
00:18:22,192 --> 00:18:24,850
and things that you want that you might
wanna make and that

348
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:28,213
really well hopefully one more
introductory video to make

349
00:18:28,213 --> 00:18:32,600
and that is a video where I'm just going to
talk through kind of the table of contents

350
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,859
everything we're gonna go through you
could call it a syllabus if you want to

351
00:18:35,859 --> 00:18:36,649
but I'm kind

352
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:40,684
of afraid to do that. so I'm gonna kind of just
give you a quick overview I think this

353
00:18:40,684 --> 00:18:43,763
I'm kinda having a problem with this is
that in the last one to a bit too long

354
00:18:43,763 --> 00:18:44,671
so

355
00:18:44,671 --> 00:18:47,272
and give you a quick overview all the
fundamentals are going to learn

356
00:18:47,272 --> 00:18:49,926
and then we're just gonna dive right in and
get started
