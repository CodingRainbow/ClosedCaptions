1
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:04,950
okay this is the last introductory video

2
00:00:04,993 --> 00:00:08,293
before we get into the actual stuff - 
it really is the

3
00:00:08,293 --> 00:00:13,079
exciting part where you're going to look
at examples, start writing your own code,

4
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:16,110
start making stuff, coming up with your
ideas, trying things out -

5
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:19,599
before you start making things, I just
want to give you an overview

6
00:00:19,599 --> 00:00:23,100
as to what my plan is for all these
videos, so

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:28,283
there's a key thing here -
pick up some energy back here, run in

8
00:00:28,283 --> 00:00:29,378
place, run in place - okay

9
00:00:29,378 --> 00:00:32,940
there's a key thing here. 
I want these videos to cover

10
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,772
the fundamentals of computation, 
the fundamental building blocks

11
00:00:36,772 --> 00:00:38,532
of computer programming,

12
00:00:38,532 --> 00:00:42,323
and really, there is a short list of
things that you need to know and

13
00:00:42,323 --> 00:00:44,627
understand, there are these core 
elements that will go across

14
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:48,585
any type of software development, 
creative coding,

15
00:00:48,585 --> 00:00:51,021
computer science, whatever 
you want to call it,

16
00:00:51,021 --> 00:00:55,437
writing code on your computer,
and really actually

17
00:00:55,437 --> 00:01:00,656
three categories, so, any computer
program that runs

18
00:01:00,656 --> 00:01:04,946
needs to have data associated with it,
right, it needs to store information about

19
00:01:04,946 --> 00:01:07,977
itself, colors, you know,

20
00:01:07,977 --> 00:01:12,081
sometimes I wish I didn't do this but
just to think about

21
00:01:12,081 --> 00:01:13,705
game programming for a second

22
00:01:13,705 --> 00:01:16,728
if you were creating the game 
Space Invaders

23
00:01:16,728 --> 00:01:20,633
you may need to keep track of the space
ship's position on the screen,

24
00:01:20,633 --> 00:01:23,288
which level is the game on,

25
00:01:23,288 --> 00:01:27,308
what's the current players score, 
there are elements data

26
00:01:27,308 --> 00:01:30,881
that a computer program needs to keep in
mind as it's running, and this is actually

27
00:01:30,881 --> 00:01:32,217
one of the first things

28
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:35,298
we will learn about which is
this concept of a variable

29
00:01:35,298 --> 00:01:37,901
this thing that stores data.

30
00:01:37,901 --> 00:01:43,255
In addition, I'm gonna go out over here, in
addition to this idea of a variable which

31
00:01:43,255 --> 00:01:47,490
individual piece of data - is an

32
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:50,210
Okay, don't worry, everything's okay, there's
a floor, and I just dropped the cap -

33
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,478
in addition to a variable which is
an individual piece of data

34
00:01:53,478 --> 00:01:55,295
we're also going to learn about

35
00:01:55,295 --> 00:01:58,534
something called an array, which we
could also think of

36
00:01:58,534 --> 00:02:01,701
as a list, so what about a list of data

37
00:02:01,701 --> 00:02:05,283
instead of like a spaceship as an
individual location, what if there are

38
00:02:05,283 --> 00:02:06,512
10 enemies on screen

39
00:02:06,512 --> 00:02:11,595
could we have a list of enemy locations? So
any computer program needs to store data

40
00:02:11,595 --> 00:02:15,657
we're gonna learn about variables and arrays. The
other thing that we need to really

41
00:02:15,657 --> 00:02:20,344
learn about is this idea of control. How
do we control the flow

42
00:02:20,344 --> 00:02:24,238
of a computer program, how do we
control the path by which it takes,

43
00:02:24,238 --> 00:02:28,801
right, if the spaceship - 
I wish I could think of

44
00:02:28,801 --> 00:02:32,561
something less violent - 
shoots its laser

45
00:02:32,561 --> 00:02:37,247
and hits the enemy its score goes up, 
right, how do we control that,

46
00:02:37,247 --> 00:02:40,904
how do we control that process,

47
00:02:40,904 --> 00:02:45,966
if the player dropped a seed and a
flower blooms,

48
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:47,561
that's a nicer way of thinking about it, so,

49
00:02:47,561 --> 00:02:51,601
we want to look at this idea of
conditionals, conditional logic,

50
00:02:51,601 --> 00:02:55,810
if statements, if this condition is met

51
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:59,307
then the program executes this
instruction, alright,

52
00:02:59,307 --> 00:03:02,411
that's something we're gonna look at.
Another control structure we're gonna

53
00:03:02,411 --> 00:03:05,130
is a loop, right, this idea repeating

54
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:08,672
if we have 100 enemy spaceships,

55
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:12,349
do we want to have a hundred lines of
code - draw spaceship one

56
00:03:12,349 --> 00:03:16,399
draw space ship two, draw space ship three - 
no, we want to have this loop

57
00:03:16,399 --> 00:03:19,941
draw every spaceship, for every spaceship

58
00:03:19,941 --> 00:03:24,127
draw it on the screen, so this is this
idea, really simple, these are these

59
00:03:24,127 --> 00:03:25,461
fundamentals, we're gonna have

60
00:03:25,461 --> 00:03:29,408
a set of videos about each one of these -
how do we deal with a variable,

61
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:32,940
how do we deal with a conditional ,how do we
deal with a loop, how do we deal with an array

62
00:03:37,669 --> 00:03:39,220
thinking about

63
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:37,669
but another thing that's going to be
very primary to this video series is

64
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,532
organizing, I want to say organization,

65
00:03:42,532 --> 00:03:45,980
thinking about how you organize your
code, so

66
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:49,408
when we first start we're gonna be
reading very simple instructions,

67
00:03:49,408 --> 00:03:52,742
line, fill, which is set a color,

68
00:03:52,742 --> 00:03:56,198
rectangle, ellipse, just for drawing stuff
on the screen

69
00:03:56,198 --> 00:04:00,196
but as we write larger and larger
programs we need to encapsulate

70
00:04:00,196 --> 00:04:03,092
ideas into kinda their own mini-programs in

71
00:04:03,092 --> 00:04:06,947
a way, so, the two kind of key principles

72
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:10,206
of organization that we're going to look at is how
to write a function,

73
00:04:10,206 --> 00:04:14,144
what if we figure out a nice way of drawing

74
00:04:14,144 --> 00:04:17,269
a flower pattern on the screen, right,

75
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:20,499
I can't draw, this is a flower, right,

76
00:04:20,499 --> 00:04:24,583
if we figure out how to draw a flower
and we want to have 10 flowers on the screen

77
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:29,475
are we gonna rewrite all the code for
drawing a flower 10 times, maybe that was

78
00:04:29,475 --> 00:04:31,570
a hundred lines of code just to get this
pattern,

79
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:36,088
could we just take this entire idea of a
flower and put it in its own function

80
00:04:36,088 --> 00:04:40,589
so that anytime you want a flower on
screen we have a new command so to speak

81
00:04:40,589 --> 00:04:41,161
we can just say

82
00:04:41,161 --> 00:04:44,421
"flower", and even more than this idea of
functions,

83
00:04:44,421 --> 00:04:47,181
a key principle we wanna look at is objects,

84
00:04:47,181 --> 00:04:50,275
object-oriented programming. This, to me,

85
00:04:50,275 --> 00:04:54,440
is one of the ways that I really
started to feel comfortable

86
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,264
writing software,

87
00:04:55,264 --> 00:04:58,955
is once I got to the point of learning
object-oriented programming

88
00:04:58,955 --> 00:05:03,057
and understanding something and the
screen treating at in this way we look

89
00:05:03,057 --> 00:05:03,586
at the world,

90
00:05:03,586 --> 00:05:07,746
this is an object, this object had data
associated with it,

91
00:05:07,746 --> 00:05:13,624
its color is black, it is a dry erase
marker, that may be a

92
00:05:13,624 --> 00:05:17,221
piece of data, rather than a permanent
marker, and it has functionality,

93
00:05:17,221 --> 00:05:21,874
this thing I could say draw, I could take
its cap on and off, right,

94
00:05:21,874 --> 00:05:25,324
remove cap, add cap, so this idea of taking
something like a flower

95
00:05:25,324 --> 00:05:26,632
and turning into an object

96
00:05:26,632 --> 00:05:30,246
there's data about this flower, how big
how small is it, what color is it,

97
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:34,615
and it might have functionality, it could
grow, the pedals could fall,

98
00:05:34,615 --> 00:05:38,830
so this idea of something happening in a
computer graphics application

99
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:42,661
being packaged up into this object. Now
this sounds very theoretical and grand,

100
00:05:42,661 --> 00:05:45,181
or perhaps confusing right now,

101
00:05:45,181 --> 00:05:47,130
but we're going to get into the details of how to

102
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:51,391
take a program which has variables
and conditionals and loops and all this logic and

103
00:05:51,391 --> 00:05:55,420
all this data and how to organize it 
into a way that we can just say

104
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:59,513
"hey, there are seed objects and there
are flower objects and there is grass

105
00:05:59,513 --> 00:06:00,878
objects and therefore

106
00:06:00,878 --> 00:06:04,574
if we were creating some kind of garden
simulation,

107
00:06:04,574 --> 00:06:07,691
for example. So these are all the things
we want to learn.

108
00:06:07,691 --> 00:06:11,043
In some programming courses,

109
00:06:11,043 --> 00:06:13,950
something like object-oriented
programming might be something that comes

110
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:16,873
very very late in the game, almost
at the very end or

111
00:06:16,873 --> 00:06:19,677
perhaps in like a second semester even as
an advanced topic,

112
00:06:19,677 --> 00:06:21,210
but we're going to get to objects

113
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:24,072
pretty quickly because I want that to be
a fundamental way

114
00:06:24,072 --> 00:06:28,864
that we look at creating examples and
creating projects in Processing, so

115
00:06:28,864 --> 00:06:32,894
this is kinda, this is the list of
fundamentals, right,

116
00:06:32,894 --> 00:06:35,278
these are kind of computer science
fundamentals,

117
00:06:35,278 --> 00:06:36,883
I use the word computer science

118
00:06:36,883 --> 00:06:39,800
I, like, "demerit!", my goal is to

119
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:44,403
never mention the term computer science in
any these videos, anyway, I'll go

120
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:47,016
off on that ran or tangent, not rant, 
I don't like "rant",

121
00:06:47,016 --> 00:06:50,049
but anyway, edit this out please,
somebody, okay,

122
00:06:50,049 --> 00:06:53,278
so these are the fundamentals, the things

123
00:06:53,278 --> 00:06:58,381
that will transfer to any programming language 
and environment, these are

124
00:06:58,381 --> 00:07:01,525
the kind of core elements, we want to understand
these in great detail,

125
00:07:01,525 --> 00:07:06,432
without any fear or sadness, we just want to
feel happy and comfortable about all these things

126
00:07:06,432 --> 00:07:07,525
and start to practice

127
00:07:07,525 --> 00:07:09,921
writing programs,

128
00:07:09,921 --> 00:07:14,047
but once we get through this I also want to
take a look at

129
00:07:14,047 --> 00:07:19,306
some applications, so what are some types
of things that one might do, for example

130
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:23,056
I really wanna look at images, 
how do we load images

131
00:07:23,056 --> 00:07:25,587
and draw images to the screen, how do we read

132
00:07:25,587 --> 00:07:30,814
the pixels of an image and manipulate
and do image processing, how do we do the

133
00:07:30,814 --> 00:07:32,203
kinds of things that might happen

134
00:07:32,203 --> 00:07:35,109
in a piece software like Photoshop, how do we 
write that stuff from scratch

135
00:07:35,109 --> 00:07:39,188
with code, what happens if we use a
moving image like a camera

136
00:07:39,188 --> 00:07:42,723
or a video, can we do things like
computer vision,

137
00:07:42,723 --> 00:07:47,323
how do we write
software that can find somebody's face,

138
00:07:47,323 --> 00:07:51,209
how do we write software that can track
the skeleton, the human body, with the Kinect

139
00:07:51,209 --> 00:07:55,237
so I wanna have a set of
videos about

140
00:07:55,237 --> 00:07:58,877
images and pixels. 
I also want to look at

141
00:07:58,877 --> 00:08:04,092
data as a topic, so what does it
mean to load data into a program

142
00:08:04,092 --> 00:08:07,435
what are the kinds of ways
of loading data, there's

143
00:08:07,435 --> 00:08:11,806
plain text, and XML, and JSON,

144
00:08:11,806 --> 00:08:14,196
and there are all sorts of

145
00:08:14,196 --> 00:08:18,789
data classes in Processing that allow
you to load data, parse data,

146
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:22,424
and draw stuff based on that data, so what
does it mean to connect to,

147
00:08:22,424 --> 00:08:25,475
you know, data that's local versus data
that on a server,

148
00:08:25,475 --> 00:08:30,418
I wanna look at a whole set examples,
what does it mean to work with text,

149
00:08:30,418 --> 00:08:34,090
strings, what does it mean to read a
novel and count all the words

150
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:39,285
in that novel, to do a concordance, so I
wanna have a set of videos that

151
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:42,983
deal with data, and I haven't 
made these videos yet,

152
00:08:42,983 --> 00:08:45,111
so I totally don't know exactly what we're gonna do,
we could think about,

153
00:08:45,111 --> 00:08:48,265
what about 3D graphics, so I guess what I meant

154
00:08:48,265 --> 00:08:51,400
is like topics, so this video series is going to

155
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:56,565
start with the fundamentals, all the
fundamental tools of computation, and in there

156
00:08:56,565 --> 00:08:58,388
we're also going to have to learn about

157
00:08:58,388 --> 00:09:02,863
pixels and drawing and color and shape,
some basic computer graphic stuff, but

158
00:09:02,863 --> 00:09:06,637
really we're going to focus on these
fundamental core concepts of computation,

159
00:09:06,637 --> 00:09:09,741
and from there, once we have all this bag of tricks

160
00:09:09,741 --> 00:09:12,700
we're going to reinforce those ideas, do
them over and over again,

161
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,626
practice with them

162
00:09:13,626 --> 00:09:16,855
through a set of topics: 
images, pixels, data,

163
00:09:16,855 --> 00:09:20,687
3D graphics, I could come up
with some others

164
00:09:20,687 --> 00:09:23,842
but is a pretty good starting point right now.

165
00:09:23,842 --> 00:09:28,021
Integration with the web, perhaps,
what is this landscape

166
00:09:28,021 --> 00:09:32,301
of, could we do Processing on the web,
there's this thing called Processing.js,

167
00:09:32,301 --> 00:09:33,041
which is JavaScript,

168
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:35,926
we might try to look at that at
some point in the video series.

169
00:09:35,926 --> 00:09:39,011
So I think I'm kind of done 
with talking about this but

170
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:43,187
just to kind of like walk through the
order, this is gonna help me, you can stop,

171
00:09:43,187 --> 00:09:45,415
I'm just gonna organize my own
thoughts, and

172
00:09:45,415 --> 00:09:49,936
I'm gonna keep recording, why not, right,
this might be a bad idea,

173
00:09:49,936 --> 00:09:53,531
okay, so, we're in the intro

174
00:09:53,531 --> 00:09:57,726
videos right now, so we're kind of going to be done
with the intro videos

175
00:09:57,726 --> 00:10:01,767
and actually we're gonna, I guess there's 
something right before that which is the basics

176
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:05,362
of drawing in Processing, which we're going 
to start with, I'll call this like

177
00:10:05,362 --> 00:10:08,592
"1", this will be "2", once we get through the
basics of drawing,

178
00:10:08,592 --> 00:10:12,452
we're going to look at variables, 
that'll be the sort of

179
00:10:12,452 --> 00:10:15,505
videos called number three, 
then, this would be like

180
00:10:15,505 --> 00:10:19,733
if this were a course, if you were
taking a class,

181
00:10:19,733 --> 00:10:23,619
if this were anything other than just me
in this weird room rambling,

182
00:10:23,619 --> 00:10:28,151
then this would be like week one,
week two, week three, and in fact these

183
00:10:28,151 --> 00:10:31,556
videos are intended to go along with
this course that I am teaching here which is

184
00:10:31,556 --> 00:10:35,637
divided into weeks, and this would
really actually be week one,

185
00:10:35,637 --> 00:10:36,836
intro and drawing,

186
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:39,962
so I'll keep that, so this
would be variables,

187
00:10:39,962 --> 00:10:44,692
then we're going to look at
conditionals and loops,

188
00:10:44,692 --> 00:10:48,114
after that we will get

189
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:51,907
to arrays, I think I got this right,

190
00:10:51,907 --> 00:10:56,668
and then after that we will look at
functions, after that we will look at

191
00:10:56,668 --> 00:11:00,656
objects. So it's kind of like half a semester,

192
00:11:00,656 --> 00:11:05,673
six weeks, this is grossly accelerated
in many ways,

193
00:11:05,673 --> 00:11:08,705
you need a lifetime to really master all this stuff,

194
00:11:08,705 --> 00:11:13,497
I need lots more time myself, but this will be

195
00:11:13,497 --> 00:11:17,403
a kind of six-week or six video sections

196
00:11:17,403 --> 00:11:20,697
through all these topics, and again 
after that, seven

197
00:11:20,697 --> 00:11:24,516
would be images, eight would be data, maybe
I'll do that in a different order,

198
00:11:24,516 --> 00:11:26,068
nine would be 3D graphics, so

199
00:11:26,068 --> 00:11:29,026
we'll kinda get to all this stuff.

200
00:11:29,026 --> 00:11:33,027
Okay, so this hopefully gives you a
nice overview,

201
00:11:33,027 --> 00:11:37,432
I've kind of wrapped up this introductory
stuff, I feel like these were

202
00:11:37,432 --> 00:11:41,287
kind of challenging videos to make in the
sense that they're very

203
00:11:41,287 --> 00:11:46,244
kinda, it's less kind of how-to and
looking at stuff step-by-step and more

204
00:11:46,244 --> 00:11:49,305
just kinda rambling through general
concepts, and I feel like I missed so many

205
00:11:49,305 --> 00:11:50,305
things I meant to say,

206
00:11:50,305 --> 00:11:52,533
so someday I may go back and add things in

207
00:11:52,533 --> 00:11:57,297
or write some stuff in the
descriptions but if something is missing

208
00:11:57,297 --> 00:11:58,647
or something is confusing you,

209
00:11:58,647 --> 00:12:02,460
please, at this point I guess your way
to interact is to use the comments,

210
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:06,253
write a comment, ask a question there
and we could start with a

211
00:12:06,253 --> 00:12:07,380
dialogue that way,

212
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:11,032
although the videos may end up also
somewhere else embedded

213
00:12:11,032 --> 00:12:13,219
into some sort of site that has them as well.

214
00:12:13,219 --> 00:12:17,719
Okay, so that's that so I will see you

215
00:12:17,719 --> 00:12:20,281
another time, I thank you, I bid you

216
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:24,781
"adieu," apparently I'm getting into 
some French stuff in these videos

217
00:12:24,781 --> 00:12:27,634
okay, au revoir!
