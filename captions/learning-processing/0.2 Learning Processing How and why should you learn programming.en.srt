1
00:00:03,314 --> 00:00:04,764
Okay, so let's ask the question:

2
00:00:04,764 --> 00:00:08,888
Why should you learn to program the computer?

3
00:00:08,888 --> 00:00:12,521
and really, but, you know, 
we would first have to admit that

4
00:00:12,521 --> 00:00:15,696
the answer to that question might be.
"Hello, no,

5
00:00:15,696 --> 00:00:18,978
I don't need to do this I'm interested in lots of stuff

6
00:00:18,978 --> 00:00:23,509
and this does not interest me", 
and that's pretty reasonable, I mean first of all

7
00:00:23,509 --> 00:00:26,402
you should make sure you go outside, run around,

8
00:00:26,402 --> 00:00:28,320
physical exercise is very important,

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,309
food is delicious, talking to people is wonderful

10
00:00:31,309 --> 00:00:37,163
I don't know, hobbies, I like playing cards, 
I like musical theatre, I don't necessarily need

11
00:00:37,163 --> 00:00:38,257
programming for those things

12
00:00:38,257 --> 00:00:41,100
so you, you can go and have a very full life

13
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,798
and just stop these videos and really be
a happy person. At the same time,

14
00:00:45,798 --> 00:00:50,247
let's just make, let's just, let's just 
admit something: you probably use the

15
00:00:50,247 --> 00:00:51,172
computer a lot.

16
00:00:51,172 --> 00:00:55,651
you probably, it's probably a tool for work, family,

17
00:00:55,671 --> 00:01:00,913
social, you use it, right, and 
how do you use it,

18
00:01:00,913 --> 00:01:02,785
let's say you've never written a line of code

19
00:01:02,785 --> 00:01:05,195
before in your life. You probably do 
things like you use

20
00:01:05,245 --> 00:01:08,774
Chrome, or you use Photoshop,

21
00:01:08,774 --> 00:01:13,504
or you use Word, we could keep

22
00:01:13,504 --> 00:01:17,243
making a long list of stuff there. 
What are all these things?

23
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:20,471
Software! Who made these things?

24
00:01:20,471 --> 00:01:24,055
Not you, right? So, you know, they're great!

25
00:01:24,055 --> 00:01:27,201
Photoshop is really good and an 
amazing piece of software

26
00:01:27,201 --> 00:01:31,220
made by very large company and 
lots of people and you need Photoshop,

27
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:34,222
you have an image, you wanna get rid 
of the red eye

28
00:01:34,222 --> 00:01:38,678
you wanna make it brighter you wanna 
do some kind of, I don't know, filter on it to make

29
00:01:38,678 --> 00:01:39,576
it look like it was

30
00:01:39,576 --> 00:01:41,970
taken thirty years ago, 
I don't know if Photoshop does that,

31
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:48,020
you use Photoshop, but there are limits 
to what Photoshop can do

32
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:51,197
it is a tool with a set of features that are provided

33
00:01:51,197 --> 00:01:53,780
to you via an interface and you

34
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,780
can't make it do more that it does and
in fact

35
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:00,039
if you want to be creative if you 
wanna develop your own

36
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:03,863
ideas whether they're art or

37
00:02:03,863 --> 00:02:07,332
a commercial product or some just 
weird strange exploration

38
00:02:07,332 --> 00:02:11,122
you don't wanna, you don't wanna be 
limited by the tools that are provided

39
00:02:11,122 --> 00:02:11,789
for you

40
00:02:11,789 --> 00:02:16,475
you want to start with a blank slate, you know,
if you want to create a new image

41
00:02:16,475 --> 00:02:18,402
processing filter that doesn't exist

42
00:02:18,402 --> 00:02:21,967
you could do that. In this video series

43
00:02:21,967 --> 00:02:25,760
you will learn to do that, and it's not very hard!

44
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,589
I mean, there are aspects of programming 
that are incredibly hard this won't be easy

45
00:02:30,589 --> 00:02:31,746
don't get me wrong

46
00:02:31,746 --> 00:02:36,006
but this is really what we're talking about 
here everything that you do

47
00:02:36,006 --> 00:02:40,338
whether it's working with images, 
working with animation,

48
00:02:40,338 --> 00:02:43,078
writing, checking your email,

49
00:02:43,078 --> 00:02:47,901
interfacing with hardware, robotics,

50
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:52,921
everything that you do digitally starts 
from somewhere, somebody wrote the

51
00:02:52,921 --> 00:02:54,077
software to make this stuff

52
00:02:54,077 --> 00:02:58,149
work why couldn't that person be you? 
what types of things could you invent?

53
00:02:58,149 --> 00:03:01,473
what types of ideas could you come up with
if you weren't limited

54
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:05,025
to the list of tools that you can download, purchase,

55
00:03:05,025 --> 00:03:09,994
and get from, you know, other individuals 
might have released as open source

56
00:03:09,994 --> 00:03:11,044
or big companies,

57
00:03:11,044 --> 00:03:14,308
let's break all those bonds, 
let's write your own software,

58
00:03:14,308 --> 00:03:15,864
and that sounds very grand

59
00:03:15,864 --> 00:03:19,093
and ridiculous and then we're gonna be like 
and now what you're gonna learn is

60
00:03:19,093 --> 00:03:23,500
there's a red circle on the screen and it moves 
back and forth so don't me wrong,

61
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,090
this is going to be a slow process this is 
really just the beginning

62
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:29,374
I'm gonna show you some basic stuff 
you're gonna have to take it much farther

63
00:03:29,374 --> 00:03:32,478
but this will get you started in that direction if you

64
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:37,774
and hopefully will be great. now there's also
the question, if this is maybe

65
00:03:37,774 --> 00:03:39,456
why you should learn, how you should learn

66
00:03:39,456 --> 00:03:42,518
that's a more complicated one

67
00:03:42,518 --> 00:03:46,549
I'm not prepared to answer it, I'm just 
gonna try as best I can

68
00:03:46,549 --> 00:03:50,580
to communicate to you and provide
resources but again this just brings up the

69
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,642
question there are so many resources online

70
00:03:52,642 --> 00:03:56,696
that are terrific there are online courses 
you could take there's Code Academy,

71
00:03:56,696 --> 00:03:58,861
there's the Khan Academy, there's Udacity

72
00:03:58,861 --> 00:04:02,089
there's schools you can go to, there's a new

73
00:04:02,089 --> 00:04:07,414
experimental school called the School
for Poetic Computation that's opening

74
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:10,766
there's lots of stuff out there so this
is just a little resource

75
00:04:10,766 --> 00:04:14,729
through video, I'll try to supplement it with
code examples online

76
00:04:14,729 --> 00:04:19,162
with links below the video I might
hopefully create a site with some other

77
00:04:19,162 --> 00:04:20,921
tools at some point but right now

78
00:04:20,921 --> 00:04:24,713
me talking, examples you can download, 
diagrams,

79
00:04:24,713 --> 00:04:28,942
but there is something I think
is important to mention here which is

80
00:04:28,942 --> 00:04:31,169
a lot of the tools that you might - first of all,

81
00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:34,701
you know what's a nice way to learn? 
Find a friend,

82
00:04:34,701 --> 00:04:37,994
find someone you don't even know, 
sit in a room with other people

83
00:04:37,994 --> 00:04:41,283
try to program with them, ask them
questions, look at what they're doing, try

84
00:04:41,283 --> 00:04:42,918
to explain your program to a friend,

85
00:04:42,918 --> 00:04:48,138
be with people, right, we can all try to
design the most fancy, best whatever

86
00:04:48,138 --> 00:04:48,969
online

87
00:04:48,969 --> 00:04:52,626
tool that will like show you the steps
and give you immediate feedback and step

88
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,354
you through give you this exercise and

89
00:04:54,354 --> 00:04:57,178
give you all this, right, but being
with people

90
00:04:57,178 --> 00:05:01,718
and talking to people talking through
your ideas, that is probably the best way

91
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,874
to learn, now that's not what's happening
here

92
00:05:03,874 --> 00:05:07,812
I'm by myself which is a little bit
weird but I'm getting used to it

93
00:05:07,812 --> 00:05:10,668
a lot more used to it than I 
was before

94
00:05:10,668 --> 00:05:15,217
but one thing I will say also that's a
little bit different here is a lot of

95
00:05:15,217 --> 00:05:16,476
the tools

96
00:05:16,476 --> 00:05:19,758
and courses, you know, that you might take
whether it's a high school class a

97
00:05:19,758 --> 00:05:21,675
college class an online class

98
00:05:21,675 --> 00:05:25,133
firstof all they might have the word "Computer Science" in them -

99
00:05:25,133 --> 00:05:29,393
Computer Science is a really great

100
00:05:29,393 --> 00:05:32,393
field of research and study of the
science of computing,

101
00:05:32,393 --> 00:05:35,880
this is not that, we're just learning
about computation

102
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,578
how to write programming, how to write code, 
how to program and applying it

103
00:05:39,578 --> 00:05:43,296
to whatever you might be interested in.
are you interested in biology and could

104
00:05:43,296 --> 00:05:45,765
the tools of computation help you there? 
Are you interested in music

105
00:05:45,765 --> 00:05:48,994
and could the tools of computation be
something you could use

106
00:05:48,994 --> 00:05:49,726
with music and

107
00:05:49,726 --> 00:05:52,837
this is the other thing, that I don't have a test
for you to take

108
00:05:52,837 --> 00:05:55,015
don't have something to say like

109
00:05:55,015 --> 00:05:57,858
"and you will make this" when you're
finished with these videos the point

110
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:58,651
of these videos

111
00:05:58,651 --> 00:06:03,099
is for you to have a creative idea and
you don't have to have that now

112
00:06:03,099 --> 00:06:06,596
you might get inspired or try experiment
s and it doesn't have to have any

113
00:06:06,596 --> 00:06:07,813
practical value, now

114
00:06:07,813 --> 00:06:12,282
you might want to get a job which 
I think is important in a lot of ways,

115
00:06:12,282 --> 00:06:13,594
but you might also just

116
00:06:13,594 --> 00:06:17,209
feel like "I like sorbet,

117
00:06:17,209 --> 00:06:20,742
and I like bugs,

118
00:06:20,742 --> 00:06:25,469
particularly spiders, and I'm going to create 
a simulation of spiders eating sorbet,"

119
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:28,489
which actually makes no sense
whatsoever but that's the point

120
00:06:28,489 --> 00:06:32,147
you might have some idea that apparently
doesn't have any practical value that

121
00:06:32,147 --> 00:06:34,905
makes any sense but you just want to
explore it could be a visual idea

122
00:06:34,905 --> 00:06:38,696
a it could be a musical idea could be a
website, an app,

123
00:06:38,696 --> 00:06:42,738
you know, this isn't really going to
be about making products and apps

124
00:06:42,738 --> 00:06:44,758
and stuff for the web, as you're gonna see, as 
much

125
00:06:44,758 --> 00:06:50,258
but the point is you will develop 
your own ideas and make

126
00:06:50,258 --> 00:06:50,882
them and

127
00:06:50,882 --> 00:06:53,840
hopefully share them with others in some way, so

128
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,101
I will try to give little exercises and little

129
00:06:58,101 --> 00:06:58,778
questions

130
00:06:58,778 --> 00:07:04,047
and push in particular directions but
how you will learn in this particular

131
00:07:04,047 --> 00:07:04,715
context

132
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:09,349
will be about coming up with your own
creative project ideas and using the

133
00:07:09,349 --> 00:07:10,818
tools of computation

134
00:07:10,818 --> 00:07:15,526
to realize those ideas and hopefully that
will be a nice thing.

135
00:07:15,526 --> 00:07:19,057
If anybody has success with that and finds it

136
00:07:19,057 --> 00:07:21,933
useful I'd be thrilled to know. 
Okay, so that's the end of

137
00:07:21,933 --> 00:07:26,098
this particular introductory video 
and I think the

138
00:07:26,098 --> 00:07:29,858
next one is, I'm going to talk about

139
00:07:29,858 --> 00:07:33,569
actually "What is programming, what does 
it mean to write, what is programming,

140
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:36,157
what is an algorithm, what does it mean
to program the computer?"
