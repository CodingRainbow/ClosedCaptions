1
00:00:02,698 --> 00:00:05,120
ok, let's wake up

2
00:00:06,053 --> 00:00:08,905
we just kind of get this idea

3
00:00:08,905 --> 00:00:11,249
we did something so small but so meaningful

4
00:00:11,249 --> 00:00:15,196
which was to introduce this idea of a variable

5
00:00:15,196 --> 00:00:18,072
now you might feel a little bit sad

6
00:00:18,072 --> 00:00:21,185
with just this grey circle moving on the screen

7
00:00:21,185 --> 00:00:23,021
and there's not really a lot happening

8
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:25,122
and you want to have more splash, pizzaz

9
00:00:25,122 --> 00:00:26,029
in your program

10
00:00:26,029 --> 00:00:27,856
let's look at something that will get us

11
00:00:27,856 --> 00:00:29,549
practicing with variables a bit more

12
00:00:29,549 --> 00:00:33,172
and allow us to introduce much more 
variety into our code

13
00:00:33,172 --> 00:00:35,466
and that is the use of the random function

14
00:00:35,466 --> 00:00:38,434
i think this is really important for several reasons:

15
00:00:38,434 --> 00:00:44,986
number 1 is that we now know that we have two kinds of lines of code

16
00:00:44,986 --> 00:00:45,956
that we can write.

17
00:00:45,956 --> 00:00:50,911
we have a function call, like line, from a bunch of values

18
00:00:51,611 --> 00:00:54,879
to other values, and we also know we can have

19
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,369
assignment operations where we take a variable

20
00:00:58,369 --> 00:01:01,191
and set it equal to something. 
we can even take a variable

21
00:01:01,191 --> 00:01:03,098
and set it equal to itself plus something.

22
00:01:03,098 --> 00:01:05,920
we can create all sorts of mathematical expressions

23
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,420
that allows us to assign a value to a variable

24
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:15,710
but there is another way, we can actually do both of these in one line of code

25
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,732
and I'm gonna show you what I mean by that.

26
00:01:17,732 --> 00:01:26,398
we can say something like: x = random(100);

27
00:01:26,398 --> 00:01:30,189
now look at this: this is both an assignment operation,

28
00:01:30,189 --> 00:01:37,479
assign x a value, and a function call.

29
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:41,271
this is a function, it has a name, and arguments inside parentheses

30
00:01:41,271 --> 00:01:44,229
but what's so interesting about this

31
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:47,855
is random() is a different kind 
of function than line().

32
00:01:47,855 --> 00:01:49,458
and we can think of it this way:

33
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:53,779
when I call the function line() I issue a command,
a decree in a way;

34
00:01:53,779 --> 00:01:58,071
draw a line! when I call the function random() instead of issuing a decree

35
00:01:58,071 --> 00:01:59,905
I am actually asking a question:

36
00:01:59,905 --> 00:02:04,601
oh, function random(), could you please give me an answer to the question

37
00:02:04,601 --> 00:02:07,571
'what is a random number between 0 and 100?'

38
00:02:07,571 --> 00:02:12,591
and the random function will say: 'aha, here is a random number between 0 and 100: ... 27!'

39
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:16,204
and it will give me that number back and we're gonna story it in the value x.

40
00:02:16,204 --> 00:02:20,518
this is incredibly useful! 
in fact there are lots of methods

41
00:02:20,518 --> 00:02:22,901
in Processing, I think we need to make 
a video just for this one,

42
00:02:22,901 --> 00:02:27,933
that work this way. there's a function called map(), there's a function called constrain(),

43
00:02:27,933 --> 00:02:34,488
there are a lot of functions that manipulate values for you and return back the answer

44
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:39,349
to a question in a way. a random number between some minimum and some maximum.

45
00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:41,152
how is this useful to us?

46
00:02:41,152 --> 00:02:45,267
so let's look just at ... so, first of all, 
let's just be a little bit more specific

47
00:02:45,267 --> 00:02:47,558
about how the random function works.

48
00:02:47,558 --> 00:02:55,223
the random function can take 1 argument, so that argument, let's say I put 100 in here,

49
00:02:55,223 --> 00:03:01,150
is the maximum random value, 
this will give us a random value between 0 and 100,

50
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,002
a minimum and a maximum.

51
00:03:03,002 --> 00:03:10,855
it can also take two arguments: 50,100 for example

52
00:03:10,855 --> 00:03:13,408
this is the minimum and this is the maximum

53
00:03:13,408 --> 00:03:18,606
it will always give us a random number
between 50 and 100

54
00:03:18,606 --> 00:03:22,563
now the other thing I should point out about this:

55
00:03:22,563 --> 00:03:27,292
it's not giving us 51, 52, 53, 54, 55

56
00:03:27,292 --> 00:03:32,083
the random function actually gives you
a floating point value back

57
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:35,989
so in fact it 's almost giving you
an infinite number of possibilities

58
00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:44,539
we're gonna get values like 59.231789
we're gonna get 79.003512

59
00:03:44,539 --> 00:03:47,332
we're going to get floating point values.

60
00:03:47,332 --> 00:03:51,912
this is fine, for us, if we've declared
our variables as floats

61
00:03:51,912 --> 00:03:54,322
we can get a float from random() 
and everything's ok

62
00:03:54,322 --> 00:03:58,080
there are some cases when you need 
to take the result of random()

63
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,737
and convert it to an integer, and you'll see that
in examples in the future

64
00:04:01,737 --> 00:04:04,049
we do not need to worry so much 
about that right now

65
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:06,663
so this is how the random() function works.

66
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:09,517
let's go take a look at that in our program!

67
00:04:10,757 --> 00:04:12,824
we walk over here, awkwardly, ...

68
00:04:12,824 --> 00:04:16,984
ok, so for example, one thing we could just do
really briefly, really quickly

69
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:25,827
is say: let's random(0,width). 
So I actually wanna give circleX

70
00:04:25,827 --> 00:04:28,961
a random value between 0 and 
the width of the window

71
00:04:28,961 --> 00:04:33,607
and I'm gonna do something else,
I'm gonna turn off the circle's motion

72
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:37,242
by commenting out that line of code.
this is often very uselful,

73
00:04:37,242 --> 00:04:41,866
if you wanna keep a line of code
kind of in reserve but want to deactivate it

74
00:04:41,866 --> 00:04:45,856
you can just comment it out 
so it's commented, meaning the compiler

75
00:04:45,856 --> 00:04:48,855
will ignore it when it runs.
so we run this program

76
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:51,843
look, there's our circle,
it's a random location.

77
00:04:51,843 --> 00:04:54,072
let's run it again!

78
00:04:54,072 --> 00:04:58,604
woah, that was like the same location twice!
what's the odds of that?

79
00:04:58,604 --> 00:05:01,427
let's run it again and really hope 
we get something pretty different!

80
00:05:01,427 --> 00:05:04,801
ok, I feel better now. phew, there
it is over there!

81
00:05:04,801 --> 00:05:08,062
we will get a new random value 
each time the program runs.

82
00:05:08,062 --> 00:05:12,446
now you may ask yourself: 
is it REALLY random?

83
00:05:12,446 --> 00:05:15,322
like: how random is it, you know?
so the one thing we should

84
00:05:15,322 --> 00:05:19,279
just briefly mention is: this random number
comes from something known

85
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:22,728
as a pseudo-random number generator.
it is a mathematical function

86
00:05:22,728 --> 00:05:27,280
invented by people, perhaps you could 
spend your life kind of developing

87
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,487
pseudo-random number generators, 
you could ... years of study ...

88
00:05:32,487 --> 00:05:34,684
but we get one for free in Processing

89
00:05:34,684 --> 00:05:38,672
it is not perfect randomness 
in the sense of what you might find

90
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:42,495
in some occurrence of nature, I don't know,
if you heated up some gas

91
00:05:42,495 --> 00:05:45,558
and watched how all the particles 
moved around ...

92
00:05:45,558 --> 00:05:48,195
and get some sort of more pure 
random out of that

93
00:05:48,195 --> 00:05:51,047
but it will exhibit some kind
of pattern over time

94
00:05:51,047 --> 00:05:55,077
but we aren't ... we're writing, you know, 
sketches that draw little circles

95
00:05:55,077 --> 00:05:59,036
and colors on the screen, it's plenty
good random for us right now!

96
00:05:59,036 --> 00:06:02,170
but it is coming, it is just a 
mathematical function

97
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:05,264
written into Processing that gives you
a random sequence of numbers

98
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:08,930
there's other controls we can 
impose over that random as well

99
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:12,513
which are more advanced, 
that I would love to discuss with you

100
00:06:12,513 --> 00:06:15,106
some time if you'd like to
talk about that!

101
00:06:15,106 --> 00:06:18,711
ok, so now that we have that,
that's pretty pretty good

102
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:21,026
but let's think of something 
a little more interesting

103
00:06:21,026 --> 00:06:23,341
(talking about pen)

104
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,656
let's have our circle
start in the center of the window

105
00:06:25,656 --> 00:06:30,823
so the circle should start at width/2,
oh, ha, I got something for you!

106
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:34,543
remember how I was saying 
everyone just wants to give circleX's

107
00:06:34,543 --> 00:06:39,698
initial value up here, 
cause that's so much more convenient

108
00:06:39,698 --> 00:06:42,790
just to do it in one line of code?
but I just want to give you a warning:

109
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:46,323
this will not work for you now!
this will fail

110
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:50,239
because the width has not been
established until size() has been called

111
00:06:50,239 --> 00:06:53,935
this is why you wanna be careful
about initializing all your variables up here.

112
00:06:53,935 --> 00:06:57,426
sure, it's more convenient! 
and it's less code! less typing!

113
00:06:57,426 --> 00:07:01,912
most of many examples you'll see do that
but this is a nice instance

114
00:07:01,912 --> 00:07:08,882
where circleX should be initialized here

115
00:07:13,722 --> 00:07:18,901
ok, so we've established
circleX is going to be in the middle

116
00:07:18,901 --> 00:07:21,578
we're going to move circleX again

117
00:07:21,578 --> 00:07:25,579
right, it's moving by 1 but what
if I said this?

118
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:34,567
move circleX by a random value, 
and I need a little more space here,

119
00:07:34,567 --> 00:07:39,617
between -2 and 2, right?
a random number between a minimum

120
00:07:39,617 --> 00:07:43,619
value, -2, and a maximum value, +2

121
00:07:43,619 --> 00:07:47,044
Sorry, the minimum value is -2 ,
the maximum value is 2.

122
00:07:47,044 --> 00:07:51,139
instead of saying:
circleX = circleX +1 every time

123
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:54,939
through draw() we're going to say:
circleX = circleX + 1.5, sometimes

124
00:07:54,939 --> 00:07:57,856
-0.3, and sometimes .x,
sometimes -.x

125
00:07:57,856 --> 00:08:00,033
and if we run that, think about 
what it's gonna do:

126
00:08:00,033 --> 00:08:01,521
we run it

127
00:08:01,521 --> 00:08:02,678
look what's happening

128
00:08:02,678 --> 00:08:04,459
zoom in on that ... oops ...

129
00:08:04,459 --> 00:08:08,251
the circle, what is it doing?

130
00:08:08,251 --> 00:08:13,239
it's moving randomly each frame,
in a different direction

131
00:08:13,239 --> 00:08:15,459
so it gives us this jiggling like quality

132
00:08:15,459 --> 00:08:18,365
what if you had its size 
change randomly each frame?

133
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:25,385
it's gonna have this almost 
... nervous looking circle on the screen

134
00:08:25,385 --> 00:08:27,156
and it would be nice, 
maybe we could think of ways

135
00:08:27,156 --> 00:08:30,644
to calm it down, to soothe it,
and be more gentle to it

136
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:32,496
but this is kind of interesting:

137
00:08:32,496 --> 00:08:35,437
random allows us a lot of possibilities

138
00:08:35,437 --> 00:08:38,665
beyond 'just give it a random location 
where it starts'

139
00:08:38,665 --> 00:08:42,746
and that is giving us the inkling of that
how you can start to create behaviors,

140
00:08:42,746 --> 00:08:46,246
personality in a way, to the shapes
that you're drawing on the screen

141
00:08:46,246 --> 00:08:49,913
so, another thing that I just thought
that I would briefly show you

142
00:08:49,913 --> 00:08:54,995
I'm gonna save this as random2,
I guess what I might do is

143
00:08:54,995 --> 00:08:58,995
all these examples are essentially
similar to other examples I'm linking to

144
00:08:58,995 --> 00:09:02,162
but I might typing them out here
and they're slightly different

145
00:09:02,162 --> 00:09:04,725
I might, I put them somewhere else 
with the link ...

146
00:09:04,725 --> 00:09:08,359
uh, I don't need to be telling you 
this right now but ok

147
00:09:08,359 --> 00:09:10,597
so let's just look at one 
other thing,

148
00:09:10,597 --> 00:09:13,441
so here's an exercise that I might give you

149
00:09:13,441 --> 00:09:17,765
which is: use random to affect
the x, the y, the width and height

150
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:20,740
of a shape and see what type
of personality you can give it.

151
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:24,087
here's another exercise to see if 
you can use random to essentially

152
00:09:24,087 --> 00:09:25,752
create a painting on the screen.

153
00:09:25,752 --> 00:09:29,449
and let's think, what are we gonna do, 
let's do a pointillist painting.

154
00:09:29,449 --> 00:09:33,450
so, the first thing I wanna do here,
and I'm gonna get you started on this

155
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:37,710
is add 'circleY'. and the second thing
I wanna do

156
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:41,730
is draw circleY, uh, draw the circle
at that location,

157
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:44,730
and I'll give them both initial locations

158
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:47,437
and i'm gonna take out 
this line of code completely

159
00:09:47,437 --> 00:09:49,751
and I'm going to run this program

160
00:09:49,751 --> 00:09:52,788
and what do we get? we get a circle
that's in the middle of the screen

161
00:09:52,788 --> 00:09:55,959
it's x and y, width/2, height/2, there it is.

162
00:09:55,959 --> 00:10:00,999
now, what if instead of assigning
the initial value in setup

163
00:10:00,999 --> 00:10:04,291
I give it a new value every time through draw()?

164
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:09,056
and I say: hey, give it a random value 
between 0 and width

165
00:10:09,056 --> 00:10:18,810
(phone blabla)

166
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:21,830
ok, a random value between 0 and width

167
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,184
and circleY a random value
between 0 and height

168
00:10:24,184 --> 00:10:26,487
now we're doing that EVERY time through draw()

169
00:10:26,487 --> 00:10:29,540
instead of giving it a random value ONCE,
and it sticks there,

170
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,110
now we're giving it a random value
every time through draw()

171
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:34,527
look, it puts it in a different location every time

172
00:10:34,527 --> 00:10:38,401
but what if ...

173
00:10:38,401 --> 00:10:42,890
I took the background out and only
draw the background once in setup()?

174
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:45,484
now we're seeing the circle appear

175
00:10:45,484 --> 00:10:46,859
over and over again at different places

176
00:10:46,859 --> 00:10:49,567
what if I gave those circles 
a little bit of alpha?

177
00:10:49,567 --> 00:10:52,863
what if I made the size of the circles random?

178
00:10:52,863 --> 00:10:57,024
what if I made random values for the color 
of each circle?

179
00:10:57,024 --> 00:11:01,450
could I create some type of painting 
where all these random colors are blending?

180
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:04,837
could I restrain the randomness? 
could I say the red is just between

181
00:11:04,837 --> 00:11:08,970
50 and 100, and the green is 
between 150 and 175 to kind of

182
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:10,566
create a palette of colors?

183
00:11:10,566 --> 00:11:13,553
so this, I think, is a nice exercise
for you to kind of play around with

184
00:11:13,553 --> 00:11:19,115
a. can you control the motion 
of a singular shape through random?

185
00:11:19,115 --> 00:11:24,379
and also could you create kind of this
painting, this collection of stuff

186
00:11:24,379 --> 00:11:30,135
piling up with random as well and use
alpha and color and size to really create

187
00:11:30,135 --> 00:11:33,333
some kind of pattern? you know
use lines, rectangles, other shapes

188
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:36,999
besides circles? so that should get you 
kind of going with some stuff

189
00:11:36,999 --> 00:11:38,789
to play with in terms of using random()

190
00:11:38,789 --> 00:11:42,709
and, uh, that's what I got to say about that!
