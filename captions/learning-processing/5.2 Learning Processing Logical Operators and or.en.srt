1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,220
hello, ok, so here's the thing

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:03,940
if you watched the previous video

3
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:05,911
you will have noticed it was a complete disaster!

4
00:00:05,911 --> 00:00:08,636
so what I'm gonna try to do with this one

5
00:00:08,636 --> 00:00:10,663
is make this really short

6
00:00:10,663 --> 00:00:12,335
just talk about one simple topic

7
00:00:12,335 --> 00:00:14,532
it's gonna be like, I'm gonna turn the clock on

8
00:00:14,532 --> 00:00:16,913
clock is now going, I can see it

9
00:00:16,913 --> 00:00:18,683
I'm gonna try to keep this to 3 or 4 minutes

10
00:00:18,683 --> 00:00:20,761
simple topic, we're gonna discuss it

11
00:00:20,761 --> 00:00:22,146
we're gonna make one quick example

12
00:00:22,146 --> 00:00:23,344
the video will be over

13
00:00:23,344 --> 00:00:25,281
we're not gonna lose the train of thought

14
00:00:25,281 --> 00:00:26,875
we're gonna keep the energy going

15
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:29,404
and you're gonna really, it's going to be great, ok?

16
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:30,198
ok, here we go!

17
00:00:30,198 --> 00:00:33,894
today's topic for this video is logical operators

18
00:00:33,894 --> 00:00:35,623
so what have we just be doing?

19
00:00:35,623 --> 00:00:37,991
in the previous video I actually made this example

20
00:00:37,991 --> 00:00:40,754
but I talked for so long the cam just recorded
for twelve minutes

21
00:00:40,754 --> 00:00:41,786
and then cut off

22
00:00:41,786 --> 00:00:46,236
but I got to this point where we made this ... 
example where what we're saying is:

23
00:00:46,236 --> 00:00:52,372
aha, if ... now x is greater than 500 
draw a red background

24
00:00:52,372 --> 00:00:54,611
400 yellow background

25
00:00:54,611 --> 00:00:56,163
let's see where we're going here

26
00:00:56,163 --> 00:00:57,424
ah, wooh, pink, that's beautiful

27
00:00:57,424 --> 00:00:58,043
pink background

28
00:00:58,043 --> 00:01:04,094
if 300 blue, 200 ... and in all other cases: green.

29
00:01:04,094 --> 00:01:06,412
so we learned about how we can have
an if statement:

30
00:01:06,412 --> 00:01:08,507
when the condition is met, execute that code.

31
00:01:08,507 --> 00:01:10,964
when can join in a statement with 'else if'

32
00:01:10,964 --> 00:01:13,204
saying if this is true, otherwise if this is true

33
00:01:13,204 --> 00:01:15,993
and 'else' tells us in all the other cases to do this.

34
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:18,022
and I probably don't need to recap 
the previous video

35
00:01:18,022 --> 00:01:19,982
because in most cases you'll just have watched it

36
00:01:19,982 --> 00:01:21,723
but I'm gonna figure that out eventually

37
00:01:21,723 --> 00:01:23,645
it will make sense and I'll just redo all of these.

38
00:01:23,645 --> 00:01:26,104
ok, but there's one more piece.

39
00:01:26,104 --> 00:01:27,872
so this is actually everything you need to know

40
00:01:27,872 --> 00:01:29,598
to design the logic of your program

41
00:01:29,598 --> 00:01:31,159
is right here in this example

42
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:32,712
IF, ELSE IF and ELSE

43
00:01:32,712 --> 00:01:35,828
you basically, with variables and conditionals

44
00:01:35,828 --> 00:01:37,972
you can program absolutely anything!

45
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:40,174
you know, we're gonna introduce

46
00:01:40,174 --> 00:01:41,232
a lot of things to make this better

47
00:01:41,232 --> 00:01:43,649
- and it's already a minute and a half, 
and I say three minutes -

48
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:44,882
so I'm gonna get back to this.

49
00:01:44,882 --> 00:01:46,753
logical operators, what we're talking about

50
00:01:46,753 --> 00:01:48,133
when we talk about logical operators

51
00:01:48,133 --> 00:01:54,773
are AND and OR, because sometimes 
we wanna say things like

52
00:01:54,773 --> 00:01:59,430
IF I'm hungry AND it's evening,
have dinner.

53
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,824
IF I'm hungry AND it's morning,
have breakfast.

54
00:02:03,824 --> 00:02:05,420
right? so we want to be able to join

55
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:09,204
two boolean expressions. 
if they're both true, do this!

56
00:02:09,204 --> 00:02:11,552
if only one of them is true, do this!

57
00:02:11,552 --> 00:02:13,474
if only one of them is true that's OR.

58
00:02:13,474 --> 00:02:15,342
by the way, there's something called 'exclusive or'

59
00:02:15,342 --> 00:02:17,164
- but I don't know why I bring this up right now -

60
00:02:17,164 --> 00:02:18,457
but it is kind of interesting

61
00:02:18,457 --> 00:02:21,363
'exclusive or' means 'they can't both be true',

62
00:02:21,363 --> 00:02:23,865
just one of them true. maybe you need that
for something but let's

63
00:02:23,865 --> 00:02:25,124
just not worry about that right now.

64
00:02:25,124 --> 00:02:28,916
this has nothing to do with anything
- unintelligble .

65
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:32,645
ok, it's like talking about 'double buffering' (?)
or something like that.

66
00:02:32,645 --> 00:02:33,915
here we go!

67
00:02:33,915 --> 00:02:34,611
AND and OR.

68
00:02:34,611 --> 00:02:36,707
how do we ... that?

69
00:02:36,707 --> 00:02:38,900
so what if I have a boolean expression

70
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,341
and I wanna know if this boolean expression

71
00:02:41,341 --> 00:02:44,101
is true and this boolean expression is true

72
00:02:44,101 --> 00:02:46,663
then execute the code that's in here.

73
00:02:46,663 --> 00:02:50,554
well, you might be thinking: oh, 
you could just write the word AND there.

74
00:02:50,554 --> 00:02:52,564
that might be nice, that would sort of make sense

75
00:02:52,564 --> 00:02:54,000
it would look right and it seems to match

76
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,813
the logic that we've been talking about.

77
00:02:55,813 --> 00:02:58,141
the thing about Processing is

78
00:02:58,141 --> 00:03:00,041
it's built on this language called Java,

79
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:03,171
which in many ways ... similar syntax

80
00:03:03,171 --> 00:03:04,528
than the programming language C

81
00:03:04,528 --> 00:03:09,431
and the logical AND is written 
with two ampersands (&&)

82
00:03:09,431 --> 00:03:12,254
- I am very good at drawing ampersands -

83
00:03:12,254 --> 00:03:14,725
which is actually not true at all, 
as you can see with this horrible ampersand

84
00:03:14,725 --> 00:03:16,015
this is an AND

85
00:03:16,015 --> 00:03:20,971
so IF this expression is true AND
this expression is true,

86
00:03:20,971 --> 00:03:23,034
the ampersands joins those,

87
00:03:23,034 --> 00:03:26,733
sometimes because I like to be 
a little bit anal about stuff

88
00:03:26,733 --> 00:03:29,232
you can put parentheses around 
the whole thing too

89
00:03:29,232 --> 00:03:32,284
because truly this whole thing 
is one boolean expression

90
00:03:32,284 --> 00:03:34,915
the whole thing evaluates to either true or false

91
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:37,001
it only happens to evaluate to true

92
00:03:37,001 --> 00:03:39,369
when both of these sub-boolean expressions

93
00:03:39,369 --> 00:03:40,802
also evaluate to true.

94
00:03:40,802 --> 00:03:43,062
so what if I wrote something like this:

95
00:03:43,062 --> 00:03:45,646
if mouseX is greater than 100

96
00:03:45,646 --> 00:03:48,979
AND mouseX is less than 50

97
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:50,521
execute this code

98
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:51,903
what's wrong with this?

99
00:03:51,903 --> 00:03:53,938
it's completely illogical!

100
00:03:53,938 --> 00:03:55,813
I mean it'll work but it is impossible.

101
00:03:55,813 --> 00:03:59,102
try, I dare you, try to come up with a number

102
00:03:59,102 --> 00:04:02,456
that is both greater than 200 and smaller than 50!

103
00:04:02,456 --> 00:04:04,783
take your time. as long as you need.

104
00:04:04,783 --> 00:04:08,717
get back to me whenever, I will do some
sort of exciting thing

105
00:04:08,717 --> 00:04:15,729
like eat a cupcake, dance on top of
a small ... stand while wearing

106
00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:20,222
a pretty outfit or something, 
I can't come up with anything right now.

107
00:04:20,222 --> 00:04:22,791
if you can come up with that number,
but it's not possible.

108
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:25,456
so just because you have these options

109
00:04:25,456 --> 00:04:26,969
doesn't mean that you automatically

110
00:04:26,969 --> 00:04:28,121
gonna write all this great code

111
00:04:28,121 --> 00:04:29,152
that's gonna do this stuff.

112
00:04:29,152 --> 00:04:31,093
it's still up to you to come up with that logic

113
00:04:31,093 --> 00:04:32,299
to implement what you want.

114
00:04:32,299 --> 00:04:35,294
let's look at a scenario where this AND 
ampersand can make sense

115
00:04:35,294 --> 00:04:37,932
so, we wanna say:

116
00:04:37,932 --> 00:04:43,224
if - we're gonna get rid of all this stuff -

117
00:04:43,224 --> 00:04:53,095
if mouseX is greater than 100 AND
if mouseX is less than 200

118
00:04:53,095 --> 00:04:59,080
and let's put those, I think it's useful,
I shouldn't have gotten rid of it,

119
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,285
to draw lines on the screen in this case

120
00:05:03,285 --> 00:05:05,252
just so we can see them

121
00:05:05,252 --> 00:05:09,140
and know where the mouse is
in relation to those numbers

122
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,072
ok, so what's the problem?

123
00:05:11,072 --> 00:05:14,460
look at me, it's good that this happened

124
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,185
'unexpected token ampersand'

125
00:05:16,185 --> 00:05:17,323
you can't really see that

126
00:05:17,323 --> 00:05:18,244
there's a way to zoom

127
00:05:18,244 --> 00:05:19,238
oh, how do I zoom?

128
00:05:19,238 --> 00:05:23,313
terrible pause, look up something on Google!

129
00:05:23,313 --> 00:05:24,552
Ok, I gotta figure that out

130
00:05:24,552 --> 00:05:26,435
I know how to do it on my laptop

131
00:05:26,435 --> 00:05:28,133
but this is like a regular keyboard

132
00:05:28,133 --> 00:05:31,000
so down here, you can't read it,
at the bottom it says:

133
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,392
'unexpected token &'

134
00:05:33,392 --> 00:05:36,041
so something must be wrong with 
the syntax back here

135
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:39,626
but ... we wrote it here, we put 
these parentheses around here

136
00:05:39,626 --> 00:05:41,301
so it's a little bit goofy

137
00:05:41,301 --> 00:05:43,482
I mean, I'm just gonna show you

138
00:05:43,482 --> 00:05:44,853
if I took these parentheses out

139
00:05:44,853 --> 00:05:46,037
it's gonna work

140
00:05:46,037 --> 00:05:50,821
so this is gonna be fine.
remember you need to have parentheses

141
00:05:50,821 --> 00:05:53,404
that are going around 
the entire boolean expression

142
00:05:53,404 --> 00:05:56,996
the way I had it before, like this, 
there were no parentheses

143
00:05:56,996 --> 00:05:59,027
going around the entire boolean expression

144
00:05:59,027 --> 00:06:04,121
this will also work because we can have
parentheses around the other

145
00:06:04,121 --> 00:06:07,380
boolean expressions. this, I would say, 
is probably a good way to write it

146
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,621
just to be most clear right now.

147
00:06:08,621 --> 00:06:12,096
so if mouseX is greater than 100
and mouseX is less than 200

148
00:06:12,096 --> 00:06:15,097
tada tada taaaa

149
00:06:15,097 --> 00:06:16,912
ok, over here we got a black background,

150
00:06:16,912 --> 00:06:18,299
over here we got a black background,

151
00:06:18,299 --> 00:06:21,233
and inbetween we've got red, 
inbetween, because here

152
00:06:21,233 --> 00:06:23,410
is where the value is both
greater than 100

153
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:26,952
and less than 200. Six minutes
and counting ... ok.

154
00:06:26,952 --> 00:06:29,083
Ok, we've got to talk about OR.

155
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:33,106
I mean, how can I not make a video about AND and OR and have it just ...

156
00:06:33,106 --> 00:06:35,398
it could be done in three minutes, 
I don't know what going on

157
00:06:35,398 --> 00:06:39,156
gonna work on it. 
Ok: OR. The thing about this stuff

158
00:06:39,156 --> 00:06:41,799
is what's nice about these boolean expressions
and this logical stuff

159
00:06:41,799 --> 00:06:43,852
it really just follows your intuition

160
00:06:43,852 --> 00:06:45,721
I mean, you don't have to explain what AND means

161
00:06:45,721 --> 00:06:50,411
just try to say it in English: 
if mouseX is greater than 100

162
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:57,241
and less than 200, then execute this code.

163
00:06:57,241 --> 00:07:02,692
it works out. what if, ... in this case
OR is written in an even more

164
00:07:02,692 --> 00:07:05,761
cryptic way: OR is written with two pipes.

165
00:07:05,761 --> 00:07:09,021
that is OR. Okay?

166
00:07:09,021 --> 00:07:13,021
so I could say: if the mouseX is greater than 100

167
00:07:13,021 --> 00:07:17,196
OR it is less than 200 then 
what's gonna happen?

168
00:07:17,196 --> 00:07:20,984
no matter what I do it's always red! why?

169
00:07:20,984 --> 00:07:25,540
try to come up with a number that's
neither greater than 100 nor less than 200!

170
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:30,207
every number, 300 is greater than 100, 
50 happens to be less than 200

171
00:07:30,207 --> 00:07:32,675
150 is greater than 100 and less than 200

172
00:07:32,675 --> 00:07:33,899
so this is always true!

173
00:07:33,899 --> 00:07:37,841
both together with an OR , at least one of 
them is going to be true

174
00:07:37,841 --> 00:07:41,165
but now we have to case, what if we 
say: if it's greater than 200

175
00:07:41,165 --> 00:07:45,072
OR less than 100? 
what's gonna happen now?

176
00:07:45,072 --> 00:07:46,782
it's greater than 200, we have red

177
00:07:46,782 --> 00:07:48,443
it's less than 100, it's red

178
00:07:48,443 --> 00:07:52,261
but now if it's here, neither of those 
expressions evaluates to true

179
00:07:52,261 --> 00:07:56,703
it's neither greater than 200 nor less 
than 100, and we've got

180
00:07:56,703 --> 00:08:00,053
a black background now in the middle.

181
00:08:00,053 --> 00:08:04,161
this brings up an interesting point. 
there is another logical operator:

182
00:08:04,161 --> 00:08:07,191
it is called NOT. Right?

183
00:08:07,191 --> 00:08:13,742
if x is greater than 100, do something.

184
00:08:13,742 --> 00:08:17,681
what if I was saying:
if x is NOT greater than 100, do something?

185
00:08:17,681 --> 00:08:19,654
this is very, very useful!

186
00:08:19,654 --> 00:08:22,201
oftentimes you want to sort of do the inverse.

187
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:27,382
so I could say right here: 
if this entire boolean expression

188
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:32,669
is not true, and that's not the right syntax ...

189
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:34,981
.... probably put another set of parentheses around

190
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:36,697
you know, I don't know what's wrong with me today

191
00:08:36,697 --> 00:08:40,272
I just completely lost my mind but, uhm, 
this is the complete opposite

192
00:08:40,272 --> 00:08:45,355
so now if, we can certainly the crazy, 
by the way, we've just gone off

193
00:08:45,355 --> 00:08:49,483
the deep end here, this is a nice little
demonstration but the point of this

194
00:08:49,483 --> 00:08:54,027
was to kind of understand OR, AND and NOT.

195
00:08:54,027 --> 00:08:57,021
so you can use these in all kinds of combinations

196
00:08:57,021 --> 00:09:00,572
you can say: if this and this or this but not this

197
00:09:00,572 --> 00:09:04,300
you can create these very elaborate
boolean expressions.

198
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:08,818
for the most part it is very hard to do that
in a vacuum, we're coming up with

199
00:09:08,818 --> 00:09:11,385
these arbitrary scenarios, what you wanna do now

200
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:15,171
is figure out where is this going to be useful to you

201
00:09:15,171 --> 00:09:19,081
and I think our next video, where we will finally
return to that moving ball

202
00:09:19,081 --> 00:09:22,601
is really going to demonstrate that, 
and you're ready for this now.

203
00:09:22,601 --> 00:09:26,518
how could you say, for example,
with these structures:

204
00:09:26,518 --> 00:09:27,984
we're gonna do this in the next video

205
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:31,974
if you have a ball moving over here,
if it reaches this edge,

206
00:09:31,974 --> 00:09:35,141
or if it reaches the other edge,
how to turn around?

207
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:37,381
that's one place where OR would make sense.

208
00:09:37,381 --> 00:09:40,641
that's, it's really, you know, 
it'd be much easier

209
00:09:40,641 --> 00:09:43,267
if you were just standing here and said:
oh, I have this idea, what kind of

210
00:09:43,267 --> 00:09:45,692
logical expression do I need?
well, then we would kind of

211
00:09:45,692 --> 00:09:48,525
work that through. but with the absence 
of an idea we're just kind of

212
00:09:48,525 --> 00:09:51,317
spinning in the wind. so, maybe if I make some 
of these videos in the future

213
00:09:51,317 --> 00:09:54,657
I've got more specific examples. 
this is practically 10 minutes!!
