1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:03,748
Okay, look, let's take a step back for a second

2
00:00:03,865 --> 00:00:06,296
and let me introduce myself a little more properly.

3
00:00:06,519 --> 00:00:09,649
My name is (this is absurd but I'm writing my name over here

4
00:00:09,649 --> 00:00:15,409
on the board but) my name is [enunciating] Daniel Sheef Mon

5
00:00:15,409 --> 00:00:16,746
pronounced 'Shiffman'

6
00:00:16,746 --> 00:00:20,108
but I don't know, you can say Sheef Mon if you want

7
00:00:20,108 --> 00:00:24,463
and I work at a place called ITP which you can find out more about at

8
00:00:24,463 --> 00:00:26,603
ITP.nyu.edu

9
00:00:26,623 --> 00:00:29,271
It's a two-year graduate program and I

10
00:00:29,415 --> 00:00:32,530
teach a lot of programming courses here, one of which

11
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:35,176
in particular is a course called 'Introduction

12
00:00:35,176 --> 00:00:39,134
to Computational Media' in which the students

13
00:00:39,134 --> 00:00:43,455
learn - most them for the very first time - how to program the computer

14
00:00:43,455 --> 00:00:47,496
and we use for that course something else that I participate

15
00:00:47,496 --> 00:00:54,007
in developing, called, 'Processing,' and you can find out more about Processing

16
00:00:54,007 --> 00:00:59,539
at Processing.org so this is who I am the kind of context, at least, of what I'm doing

17
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:04,693
I imagine I'm making these videos just to try them, to learn more about teaching -

18
00:01:04,711 --> 00:01:06,617
to learn more about teaching in this strange

19
00:01:06,712 --> 00:01:12,852
new context as well as to supplement the course that I'm teaching here

20
00:01:12,852 --> 00:01:16,222
but it is my hope that all the things will kind of feed into each other in a nice

21
00:01:16,344 --> 00:01:20,661
way and that there will be some population, however small, whether it's

22
00:01:20,697 --> 00:01:23,910
three people - three hundred - three thousand - three billion - that are

23
00:01:23,922 --> 00:01:27,244
interested in this content and that this stuff that I'm going to talk about

24
00:01:27,244 --> 00:01:30,442
and demonstrate over many many, many, many, many videos

25
00:01:30,442 --> 00:01:34,864
on will be interesting to help you with - [humorously] I don't know -

26
00:01:34,864 --> 00:01:38,347
I'm really trying too hard to justify this, but I'm just doing it, you can turn it off at

27
00:01:38,347 --> 00:01:41,639
anytime you like. Okay now, who are you?

28
00:01:41,639 --> 00:01:44,820
I don't know. I would be interested in hearing from you.

29
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:48,065
But let me say a few things: this video series

30
00:01:48,065 --> 00:01:51,231
is for the complete and total beginner.

31
00:01:51,231 --> 00:01:52,971
You don't need to know anything.

32
00:01:52,971 --> 00:01:55,616
That's not entirely true. You do need to access to a computer -

33
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:58,906
you probably already do if you're watching this video - you need to know

34
00:01:58,906 --> 00:01:59,844
some basic stuff:

35
00:01:59,844 --> 00:02:02,198
how to download a piece of software, how to install it,

36
00:02:02,198 --> 00:02:05,543
yeah, how to type - that kind of stuff but really that's it.

37
00:02:05,543 --> 00:02:09,864
I will assume no knowledge whatsoever about anything that has to do with

38
00:02:09,864 --> 00:02:10,395
programming.

39
00:02:10,395 --> 00:02:13,688
we're going to really, really slowly in great detail

40
00:02:13,688 --> 00:02:15,593
build-up stuff from the beginning.

41
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:20,822
So if you already know some stuff about programming, the nice thing about these

42
00:02:20,822 --> 00:02:22,551
video series is I'm trying to keep the videos

43
00:02:22,551 --> 00:02:26,404
to between 2 and 20 minutes.

44
00:02:26,404 --> 00:02:29,664
really I want them to be like 5 or 10 minute videos but you can just skip some

45
00:02:29,664 --> 00:02:32,739
You can jump ahead. If all you're interested in how to, like, parse

46
00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:36,585
a JSON feed and get it into your Processing sketch, that's probably going to be video,

47
00:02:36,619 --> 00:02:39,349
like, number 50 or 30

48
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:41,057
or 22 - somewhere further ahead

49
00:02:41,066 --> 00:02:44,786
(it's not made yet, by the way. It doesn't exist) but you can jump ahead and do that.

50
00:02:44,815 --> 00:02:47,727
The other thing I should mention it I made some videos last year

51
00:02:47,727 --> 00:02:51,943
so as you're watching them if you suddenly think that I look much younger

52
00:02:51,943 --> 00:02:54,629
or have a strangely different length of beard,

53
00:02:54,629 --> 00:02:58,177
it's because some of the videos from last year are going to be kind of spliced

54
00:02:58,187 --> 00:02:59,925
in here although I may end up

55
00:02:59,945 --> 00:03:04,410
remaking them if they're out-of-date
or needing some

56
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,137
extra touch-up - or that sort of thing.

57
00:03:06,137 --> 00:03:10,335
So that's who I am. That's who you are -

58
00:03:10,335 --> 00:03:13,605
- or maybe you are, and you can let me know if
you are somebody different.
