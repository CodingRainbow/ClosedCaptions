1
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:06,652
We got a question, we just gotta 
get this out of the way.

2
00:00:06,682 --> 00:00:09,024
"What is programming?" I mean really...

3
00:00:09,065 --> 00:00:13,525
that answer will come about... the real
answer to that question

4
00:00:13,525 --> 00:00:16,937
reveals itself the more you do
programming.

5
00:00:16,965 --> 00:00:20,190
But let's talk about it kind of in general
for a second, the thing we have to

6
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:20,670
realize is

7
00:00:20,716 --> 00:00:23,740
okay... I wish I had like Google glasses on,
I could just like <i>POP</i>

8
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:26,991
show you what I'm looking at, but that
computer, there's a computer over there.

9
00:00:26,991 --> 00:00:31,786
It's not very smart, it's incredibly
powerful, it's kind of amazing that they

10
00:00:31,786 --> 00:00:33,526
exist, and that they can do all this stuff

11
00:00:33,526 --> 00:00:36,702
but it doesn't know how to do anything.
At all.

12
00:00:36,702 --> 00:00:39,901
Nothing! It needs human beings

13
00:00:39,901 --> 00:00:44,836
to write instructions for it to do
certain things -- to crunch some numbers, to

14
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:46,598
draw certain colors to the screen --

15
00:00:46,598 --> 00:00:50,721
everything has to be written as
instructions for the computer.

16
00:00:50,721 --> 00:00:54,086
And this is really what it means to
program, to write those instructions,

17
00:00:54,086 --> 00:00:57,149
to write an algorithm. 
What is an algorithm? It's just

18
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:01,762
a sequential list of instructions that
solve a particular problem.

19
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:06,523
An algorithm for example -- I can't believe
I'm going to use this as an example but

20
00:01:06,523 --> 00:01:08,428
you know "you put your right hand in,

21
00:01:08,428 --> 00:01:12,074
you put your right hand out, you put your right
hand in and you shake it all about".

22
00:01:12,074 --> 00:01:16,146
You know "Hokey Pokey". It feels really
ridiculous to do but that,

23
00:01:16,146 --> 00:01:20,437
that's a program. Not for a computer to
follow perhaps but for a

24
00:01:20,437 --> 00:01:25,094
toddler. As you may be painfully aware
these videos are not planned or

25
00:01:25,094 --> 00:01:26,052
rehearsed!

26
00:01:26,052 --> 00:01:30,988
That might be a good idea to start doing but
I went off on a tangent about the Hokey Pokey

27
00:01:30,988 --> 00:01:34,426
I don't edit them either but this is a
moment we're editing.

28
00:01:34,477 --> 00:01:38,248
So let's let's just sort of think of another
example here, OK?

29
00:01:38,248 --> 00:01:41,446
So let's say that you need to...

30
00:01:41,446 --> 00:01:45,916
you've met somebody who has very poor
dental hygiene(?) and they

31
00:01:45,916 --> 00:01:48,549
never brush their teeth, and you need to
explain to them

32
00:01:48,549 --> 00:01:51,674
how to brush your teeth. Well, how would
you do that? You might say

33
00:01:51,674 --> 00:01:55,777
"you know the toothbrush, put toothpaste
on it and like brush it back and forth".

34
00:01:55,777 --> 00:02:00,455
Right? That might be some instructions.
But what we have to realize with programming,

35
00:02:00,455 --> 00:02:01,987
and one of the things that makes programming

36
00:02:01,987 --> 00:02:04,944
hard, is this fact that the computer
doesn't have any intuition

37
00:02:04,944 --> 00:02:08,868
or ability to -- you know -- to communicate

38
00:02:08,868 --> 00:02:12,127
from human being to another human
being with instructions. There's body

39
00:02:12,127 --> 00:02:13,754
language, there's intuition, there's

40
00:02:13,754 --> 00:02:16,160
all sorts of ways that we communicate

41
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,895
without kinda detail and specificity.
Writing computer programs,

42
00:02:21,895 --> 00:02:25,085
you need that specificity and that's
one of the things that's going to make it

43
00:02:25,085 --> 00:02:26,303
hard I guess, is

44
00:02:26,303 --> 00:02:29,397
understanding the syntax and the
fact that if I say...

45
00:02:29,397 --> 00:02:34,845
um... "teeth your brush", you could probably 
figure out -- that sounds a little weird --

46
00:02:34,845 --> 00:02:36,917
that I meant to say "brush your teeth".

47
00:02:36,917 --> 00:02:40,805
But a computer, you know, if you just left
out one word, one

48
00:02:40,805 --> 00:02:45,438
letter, one semi-colon, one piece of
punctuation, the whole thing's just

49
00:02:45,438 --> 00:02:48,897
not going to work at all and that's
going to make things kinda challenging.

50
00:02:48,897 --> 00:02:52,842
The other... the so... but let's return to
this brushing your teeth. So let's let's

51
00:02:52,842 --> 00:02:55,104
actually be even a little bit more
specific. We might say

52
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:57,926
you know the first step is "locate

53
00:02:57,926 --> 00:03:02,131
toothbrush", right?

54
00:03:02,131 --> 00:03:07,883
The next step is "locate toothpaste". I
don't know how absurd we need to get

55
00:03:07,883 --> 00:03:11,204
you know... pick... you know, you know, 
we could say like

56
00:03:11,204 --> 00:03:14,144
"move finger one away from thumb".

57
00:03:14,144 --> 00:03:17,966
You know, "Use the fingers to pick up the
toothbrush", right? We could get so crazy

58
00:03:17,966 --> 00:03:18,965
specific. But you know,

59
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:22,924
we need to say like "squeeze the
toothpaste onto the toothbrush", right?

60
00:03:22,924 --> 00:03:24,716
There's just a sequence of steps here.

61
00:03:24,716 --> 00:03:28,786
And you know rather go through this
myself you might take this as a little

62
00:03:28,786 --> 00:03:29,557
exercise to

63
00:03:29,557 --> 00:03:32,880
yourself -- you know, really try to do
this, and then you know, find a

64
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:37,837
very willing and kind friend to try to
follow the instructions literally and

65
00:03:37,837 --> 00:03:38,639
see like

66
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:41,836
did they perform the program correctly?
Were there are bugs in your system,

67
00:03:41,836 --> 00:03:42,493
right?

68
00:03:42,493 --> 00:03:46,722
You know how how does that
really work? But I want to mention a few

69
00:03:46,722 --> 00:03:47,788
other things about

70
00:03:47,788 --> 00:03:52,086
this. So let's say um...let's 
consider the following

71
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:56,668
What if I said even before this step

72
00:03:57,327 --> 00:04:00,761
"If it 9 a.m. do this."? Right, so

73
00:04:00,761 --> 00:04:04,398
if it is 9 a.m.

74
00:04:04,398 --> 00:04:09,104
locate your toothbrush, locate your 
toothpaste, start these steps. So these are the

75
00:04:09,104 --> 00:04:10,386
things that we...

76
00:04:10,386 --> 00:04:12,948
that I'm just starting to point out,
the fact that programming,

77
00:04:12,948 --> 00:04:16,126
it isn't just a matter of saying 
"do this, do that,

78
00:04:16,126 --> 00:04:19,825
do this". There are... there's logic, there's

79
00:04:19,825 --> 00:04:24,426
there's there's a sort of sophisticated
logic that possible here, where

80
00:04:24,426 --> 00:04:28,217
we start having conditions "if <i>this</i>
condition is met perform <i>these</i> steps".

81
00:04:28,217 --> 00:04:31,311
That's one of the things that you want to
start thinking about right? "If it's the

82
00:04:31,311 --> 00:04:32,135
morning brush your teeth.

83
00:04:32,135 --> 00:04:37,362
If it's noon... I don't know... stop making this 
video and go eat some lunch for God's sake."

84
00:04:37,362 --> 00:04:40,726
I'm feeling a little like... woozy

85
00:04:40,726 --> 00:04:43,350
but I think everything's gonna be fine,
don't worry.

86
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:47,351
Okay, so that's another thing. The
other thing I might mention is that

87
00:04:47,351 --> 00:04:48,709
you might say "Okay, move...

88
00:04:48,709 --> 00:04:53,099
you might... we might have a step
which is somewhere further along,

89
00:04:53,099 --> 00:04:58,453
"Put bristles on front teeth."

90
00:04:58,453 --> 00:05:01,421
The next step is "Move

91
00:05:01,421 --> 00:05:05,121
bristles horizontally

92
00:05:05,121 --> 00:05:10,473
and rapidly back and forth." Or something.
I'm just making up these steps.

93
00:05:10,473 --> 00:05:13,900
"Move the bristles horizontally amd rapidly
back and forth".

94
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,659
I don't know... is this really... am I really
here talking about how to brush your teeth?

95
00:05:17,659 --> 00:05:20,596
Oh my goodness. So you might do this, but

96
00:05:20,596 --> 00:05:24,357
but but one thing we might say here
also is "repeat

97
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:27,086
number six

98
00:05:27,086 --> 00:05:31,440
ten times." Sorry, I'm just showing you that

99
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,762
as you start to write out these steps,
think about "Are there conditions? Are

100
00:05:35,762 --> 00:05:37,323
there things that get repeated?"

101
00:05:37,323 --> 00:05:38,961
How would you really design

102
00:05:38,961 --> 00:05:42,284
this algorithm that has a beginning, a
middle and an end

103
00:05:42,284 --> 00:05:45,386
that someone could follow and no detail
would be lost?

104
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:49,406
This is really the beginning of writing
a computer program. And if you think

105
00:05:49,406 --> 00:05:50,178
about

106
00:05:50,178 --> 00:05:53,438
making the game "Pong" you're really going to
be doing the same thing,

107
00:05:53,438 --> 00:05:57,760
right? You're going to be saying "Draw a
rectangle on the left side of the screen.

108
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,115
Draw a rectangle on the right side of
the screen. Draw a

109
00:06:00,115 --> 00:06:06,477
rectangle... a circle... in the middle. Move
the circle towards the rectangle. If the

110
00:06:06,477 --> 00:06:08,238
circle hits the rectangle, turn

111
00:06:08,238 --> 00:06:11,706
the circle around, right?" This set 
of steps -- "If the circle goes past the

112
00:06:11,706 --> 00:06:12,958
rectangle, increase

113
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:15,758
the score of the other player
by one", right?

114
00:06:15,758 --> 00:06:19,353
Try to write out a list of
instructions in English

115
00:06:19,353 --> 00:06:23,840
for the game "Pong". Now there's a couple
things I want to mention about this

116
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,402
which is sort of exciting. One is

117
00:06:25,402 --> 00:06:29,006
we have just described this concept

118
00:06:29,006 --> 00:06:33,266
known as -- I don't think I spelled it
right -- "pseudo-codeo".

119
00:06:33,266 --> 00:06:35,796
Pseudocode. This is something

120
00:06:35,796 --> 00:06:41,558
that... uh... you will want to do in your
future life, unless you've already turned this off

121
00:06:41,558 --> 00:06:45,546
and you're bike riding or... I don't 
know, having a nice

122
00:06:45,546 --> 00:06:50,265
salad with a little... some nuts and 
cranberries is nice. But anyway...

123
00:06:50,265 --> 00:06:52,963
but pseudocode is something

124
00:06:52,963 --> 00:06:56,951
that you want to get used to doing, right?
The syntax of programing can be

125
00:06:56,951 --> 00:06:57,981
challenging,

126
00:06:57,981 --> 00:07:01,244
difficult and hard to do. If you can plan
out your code

127
00:07:01,244 --> 00:07:06,241
in English -- or whatever your language is,
whatever your language you think and

128
00:07:06,241 --> 00:07:07,273
write and speak in --

129
00:07:07,273 --> 00:07:10,972
then you can begin to design the
steps of your program

130
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:14,667
in advance, which will help you when you
go to sit down to actually write the

131
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:18,397
actual code. But the other thing this
brings up, which I think...

132
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:21,917
I don't know if this has a real name
anywhere other than in my

133
00:07:21,917 --> 00:07:24,844
mind... but I'm going to say this thing 
called the 'philosophy

134
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:28,480
of incremental development'.

135
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:33,804
Here's the real reason why programming
is hard, why everything we're gonna do

136
00:07:33,804 --> 00:07:36,666
is going to be challenging and not going
to be just...

137
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:41,082
you're not going to do it instantly and you're
going to struggle. You have a very very

138
00:07:41,082 --> 00:07:42,553
incredibly powerful

139
00:07:42,553 --> 00:07:47,478
thing in your head, which is your brain.
And you can think about all sorts of

140
00:07:47,478 --> 00:07:49,404
sophisticated systems and ideas and

141
00:07:49,404 --> 00:07:52,925
design ideas and come up with the steps, 
the pseudocode,

142
00:07:52,925 --> 00:07:56,427
and understand how stuff works, right? 
Maybe you haven't played the game

143
00:07:56,427 --> 00:08:00,755
"Pong" before, but if you have, you kind of
know how it works. You could describe it

144
00:08:00,755 --> 00:08:01,904
to me, you could understand,

145
00:08:01,911 --> 00:08:05,729
you could probably without watching a
single video anymore you could sort

146
00:08:05,729 --> 00:08:06,564
of describe

147
00:08:06,564 --> 00:08:08,990
how to write the computer program 
for "Pong".

148
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:13,312
But actually putting that down into code, 
all at once,

149
00:08:13,312 --> 00:08:19,041
is kinda impossible. This idea
that you really need to get used to

150
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,038
is taking an idea like "Pong"...

151
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:24,404
let's say the project -- and and you're gonna
come up with

152
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:30,132
hopefully much more interesting and exciting
creative ideas -- the project "Pong"...

153
00:08:30,132 --> 00:08:33,581
Ah, I just realized I forgot to mention all
the stuff in the introductory video, but

154
00:08:33,581 --> 00:08:35,343
I'll figure out how to fit
it in somewhere.

155
00:08:35,343 --> 00:08:40,860
The project "Pong", you wanna break that
down in your head

156
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:44,424
into lots and lots of mini programs, right?

157
00:08:44,424 --> 00:08:47,379
Here's a mini program for you, 
one that draws

158
00:08:47,379 --> 00:08:51,079
a rectangle on the screen. One that moves

159
00:08:51,079 --> 00:08:53,743
the rectangle up and down, 
just with the keys,

160
00:08:53,743 --> 00:08:58,627
right? The up and down keys for 
example. Another program is one

161
00:08:58,627 --> 00:09:02,065
that just draws a circle in the middle
of the screen, that moves the circle,

162
00:09:02,065 --> 00:09:05,618
that turns the circle around 
when it... you need lots and lots

163
00:09:05,618 --> 00:09:09,147
of little pieces. A program that... 
um... you can

164
00:09:09,147 --> 00:09:12,315
hava a number appear on the screen that
can go up and down,

165
00:09:12,315 --> 00:09:16,043
maybe randomly. You need to divide "Pong" 
into lots and lots...

166
00:09:16,043 --> 00:09:19,127
"Pong" wasn't the best example... but 
you want to divide

167
00:09:19,127 --> 00:09:23,552
"Pong" into lots and lots of mini programs, 
and make all those mini programs

168
00:09:23,552 --> 00:09:27,213
one at a time. Then you can start to
piece them together.

169
00:09:27,213 --> 00:09:31,929
You can't just sit down, "Do do do do 
do do do do do do do...

170
00:09:31,929 --> 00:09:33,394
I'm writing code for an hour or
two.

171
00:09:33,394 --> 00:09:37,624
Finished. Done. Run. Ah, I have "Pong".

172
00:09:37,624 --> 00:09:40,883
You need to make lots and lots 
of mini steps, and

173
00:09:40,883 --> 00:09:44,316
accomplish them one at a time. Always run
your program, always make sure it's still

174
00:09:44,316 --> 00:09:46,073
working. Otherwise,

175
00:09:46,073 --> 00:09:48,872
if you write a ton of code,
and then run it and it doesn't work,

176
00:09:48,872 --> 00:09:52,372
where are you... how are you going to know what 
went wrong? Right? This idea of making

177
00:09:52,372 --> 00:09:56,162
little incremental changes, taking a
larger problem and breaking down into

178
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:57,052
smaller pieces,

179
00:09:57,052 --> 00:10:00,257
this is how you going to make stuff. But
this is going to feel wrong to you

180
00:10:00,257 --> 00:10:03,943
because you understand how it all works, 
and it's going to seem almost very

181
00:10:03,943 --> 00:10:08,236
kindergarten-esque. Kindergarten is
a wonderful place by the way, we should all just

182
00:10:08,236 --> 00:10:11,911
live in perpetual kindergarten, we'd all be
much happier. I don't mean that in a bad

183
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:12,995
way, but it's going

184
00:10:12,995 --> 00:10:16,025
to seem like I should be
able to move faster than this.

185
00:10:16,025 --> 00:10:19,078
I should be able to do this more quickly,
with more agility,

186
00:10:19,078 --> 00:10:22,078
but you have to think about it -- this is a
very very flawed

187
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:26,775
analogy here -- but you think about
learning a new language,

188
00:10:26,775 --> 00:10:30,192
you know, a new foreign language,
you'e not going to pick it up

189
00:10:30,192 --> 00:10:31,004
immediately.

190
00:10:31,004 --> 00:10:33,854
It's going to be a long process, and the
same is true for learning this new

191
00:10:33,854 --> 00:10:34,679
language

192
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:37,751
of writing code. Okay,

193
00:10:37,751 --> 00:10:41,701
so that's really "What is programming?"
Kinda what is your first

194
00:10:41,701 --> 00:10:42,637
program,

195
00:10:42,637 --> 00:10:45,397
how we're thinking about and how we're going to
approach all these problems

196
00:10:45,397 --> 00:10:49,188
as we begin to write actual examples, 
which we're getting to very soon.

197
00:10:49,188 --> 00:10:53,094
The nice thing about this is you can always
just stop and move right to it. I think

198
00:10:53,094 --> 00:10:55,323
the next video was gonna, I'm just going to
talk about different programming

199
00:10:55,323 --> 00:10:55,920
languages,

200
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,060
and this language called Processing, and
why I'm using it in this video series, and what

201
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,560
the pros and cons of that are.

202
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,843
So that will be next.

203
00:11:03,843 --> 00:11:06,487
Whew. Pause
