1
00:00:02,934 --> 00:00:06,498
So here we are, this is the last video
in this little section

2
00:00:06,498 --> 00:00:09,082
about variables in p5js
and before I go,

3
00:00:09,082 --> 00:00:11,453
although I'm not going anywhere 
because all I do is stay in this room

4
00:00:11,453 --> 00:00:14,484
and make videos, 
before I go on to the next topic,

5
00:00:14,484 --> 00:00:16,726
which is conditional logic, 
which will really unlock a lot

6
00:00:16,726 --> 00:00:20,049
of creative possibilities for you,
I wanna give you one last tool

7
00:00:20,049 --> 00:00:24,516
that hopefully will make things 
a little bit more exciting, in your life.

8
00:00:26,116 --> 00:00:27,820
And that is the random() function.

9
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,248
So the random() function ...

10
00:00:31,788 --> 00:00:36,661
We, you and me, together, 
have been doing a lot of stuff like this:

11
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:41,373
var x = 50; 
and this is well and good,

12
00:00:41,373 --> 00:00:45,704
because x is a variable and
50 is a perfectly fine number

13
00:00:45,704 --> 00:00:48,297
and I'm happy with my rectangle
at pixel 50.

14
00:00:48,297 --> 00:00:53,133
But there might be a time ... the whole point
of doing this programming thing

15
00:00:53,133 --> 00:00:58,445
is to have systems of logic, 
rules to generate behaviors

16
00:00:58,445 --> 00:01:00,267
and graphics and designs.

17
00:01:00,267 --> 00:01:03,592
It's not really about let me pick
my five favorite numbers

18
00:01:03,592 --> 00:01:05,725
and set those variables to those numbers.

19
00:01:05,725 --> 00:01:08,257
So there is a lot more to it,
but a first step in that direction

20
00:01:08,257 --> 00:01:10,161
is that we can at least say:
here is the rule,

21
00:01:10,161 --> 00:01:15,213
whenever my programs runs,
the circle will appear at a random x-location.

22
00:01:16,143 --> 00:01:20,278
So instead of saying var x = 50;
I could say something like

23
00:01:20,278 --> 00:01:26,632
var x = random ... and random()
is a function just like any other function,

24
00:01:27,342 --> 00:01:32,573
line(), ellipse(), fill(), stroke(), 
it requires some arguments

25
00:01:32,573 --> 00:01:37,570
to define how that function will behave,
and random(), if you've watched

26
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:40,309
the previous video, is just like 
the map() function,

27
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:44,602
and if you recall, or if you didn't watch it,
the difference is when you say

28
00:01:44,602 --> 00:01:49,362
line(), a line is drawn on the screen,
the line function performs a task.

29
00:01:49,362 --> 00:01:53,701
When you say random(), a task is performed
(picking a random number)

30
00:01:53,701 --> 00:01:56,941
but that function resolves to, 
evaluates to that number

31
00:01:56,941 --> 00:01:58,600
and you can take that number

32
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,892
what it resolves to and assign it 
back to something,

33
00:02:03,892 --> 00:02:05,601
a variable value in this case.

34
00:02:05,601 --> 00:02:08,360
So if I say 0 comma 50

35
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,701
the parameters, the arguments that 
random() takes

36
00:02:13,701 --> 00:02:17,673
are a minimum and a maximum.

37
00:02:17,673 --> 00:02:22,173
And random() will give you a number
inbetween 0 and 50.

38
00:02:22,173 --> 00:02:28,043
One thing that's important here to realize,
which is a small, little distinction,

39
00:02:28,043 --> 00:02:34,932
is that, here's some numbers that you
might get: 2, 21, 73 .. uh, no, not 73,

40
00:02:34,932 --> 00:02:36,076
that's above 50!

41
00:02:36,076 --> 00:02:40,965
42, but I will mention you probably
won't ever get these ... you COULD

42
00:02:40,965 --> 00:02:47,545
get these but more likely you'll get numbers
like this ... it's giving you, what is

43
00:02:47,545 --> 00:02:50,580
sometimes referred to as 
floating point numbers or decimal numbers.

44
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,793
So in this case it doesn't really matter,
p5 can handle that.

45
00:02:53,793 --> 00:02:59,161
If you get the number 50.34567 it knows
to just draw something at pixel 50.

46
00:02:59,161 --> 00:03:02,356
But there is other cases where
we might need to do a little something

47
00:03:02,356 --> 00:03:04,453
more with that. 
I should probably not have mentioned this ...

48
00:03:04,453 --> 00:03:07,920
cause it's a little unnecessary
point of confusion but I've already

49
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,876
started , restarted this video like 5 times!

50
00:03:09,876 --> 00:03:11,213
So I am going for it.

51
00:03:11,213 --> 00:03:15,605
Ok, so let's actually start messing
around with this and see what happens.

52
00:03:16,425 --> 00:03:18,004
Ok, so I have a sketch here ...

53
00:03:18,004 --> 00:03:19,972
Actually, I'm gonna start a new one ...

54
00:03:19,972 --> 00:03:29,812
...

55
00:03:29,812 --> 00:03:33,864
and what I would like to do 
is have some variables,

56
00:03:33,864 --> 00:03:37,605
and I'm gonna use objects, since we
learned about, I've covered them

57
00:03:37,605 --> 00:03:39,135
in a previous video.

58
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:41,263
So I have a point

59
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:44,700
and I'm also gonna have a color

60
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:53,781
Let's see how I'm doing here 
with just having learned Javascript syntax!

61
00:03:53,781 --> 00:03:56,845
So you can see I'm setting up
a couple variables

62
00:03:57,555 --> 00:04:02,494
I wanna have a 'point' that has
an x and a y,

63
00:04:02,494 --> 00:04:05,332
I wanna have a 'col' that has
a 'r', a 'g', and a 'b' because

64
00:04:05,332 --> 00:04:10,189
my plan for all this is, first in setup, 
obviously to create a canvas,

65
00:04:10,189 --> 00:04:15,546
let's make it a nice small size,
and then what I'm gonna do

66
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:19,722
is I'm gonna set a background
in setup() cause background()

67
00:04:19,722 --> 00:04:21,188
should just happen once.

68
00:04:21,188 --> 00:04:27,045
And then an ellipse ... I'm gonna
draw the ellipse at point.x, point.y

69
00:04:27,045 --> 00:04:36,177
it's gonna be a small ellipse,
and I'm gonna fill it with col.r, col.g and col.b

70
00:04:37,157 --> 00:04:42,133
So I can zoom back out here 
and we can see we should be able to run

71
00:04:42,133 --> 00:04:45,792
this sketch now, hit run ...

72
00:04:45,792 --> 00:04:48,621
Uh, ok, 'problem with scope' ...

73
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,329
What happened?

74
00:04:50,739 --> 00:04:52,488
Look at this, interesting.

75
00:04:52,488 --> 00:04:59,395
ellipse is receiving an empty variable
in spot number 1, 2 ... this is not intentional ...

76
00:04:59,395 --> 00:05:04,735
[trying to figure out the problem]

77
00:05:04,735 --> 00:05:06,118
I put some semicolons here ...

78
00:05:06,118 --> 00:05:07,707
What did I miss?

79
00:05:14,237 --> 00:05:15,087
Help!

80
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:19,354
Look at this ...

81
00:05:22,354 --> 00:05:23,848
What am I doing here?

82
00:05:23,848 --> 00:05:27,172
Oh, ellipse ... no, oh, look!

83
00:05:27,172 --> 00:05:29,108
Some crazy stuff has happened here ...

84
00:05:29,108 --> 00:05:30,980
Some horrible stuff ...

85
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:33,375
this video is a disaster!

86
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,637
I'm gonna fix it ...

87
00:05:35,637 --> 00:05:38,844
I cut this out if I remember to ...

88
00:05:38,844 --> 00:05:41,199
point, comma, ...

89
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:48,165
[trying to figure out problem]

90
00:05:48,165 --> 00:05:51,345
Let's do some things ... 
First, when we have these kinds of problems

91
00:05:51,345 --> 00:05:58,292
this is a useful point, let's just comment out 
the offending lines of code,

92
00:05:58,292 --> 00:05:59,667
hit save and hit run ...

93
00:05:59,667 --> 00:06:01,230
Ok, no errors anymore!

94
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:04,813
Let's comment back in fill() ...

95
00:06:04,813 --> 00:06:06,503
We can figure out what's going on ...

96
00:06:06,503 --> 00:06:07,603
Still no errors!

97
00:06:07,603 --> 00:06:10,041
Let's draw an ellipse the old-fashioned way ...

98
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:15,333
and let's see if this works ...

99
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,333
Ok, that seems good!

100
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:19,960
Now what is wrong with 
my point.x and my point.y?

101
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,365
Let's try this ... point.x

102
00:06:22,365 --> 00:06:25,448
Let's run it again.

103
00:06:25,448 --> 00:06:28,689
Ah, 'empty variable in spot 1' ...

104
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:33,354
I wonder if 'point' ...
let's call it 'spot' ...

105
00:06:33,354 --> 00:06:35,949
I wonder if there's something wrong 
with using 'point'

106
00:06:37,469 --> 00:06:38,353
Yeah!

107
00:06:38,353 --> 00:06:41,981
Ha, that was interesting ...

108
00:06:41,981 --> 00:06:44,093
I've got to look into that!

109
00:06:44,093 --> 00:06:47,853
So I don't know if 'point' must be
some keyword that's doing ...

110
00:06:47,853 --> 00:06:50,701
Ooohhhh! I've done something horrible!

111
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:52,480
Boy, wow, this is great!

112
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,948
This is great! Ok!
I know what happened.

113
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:57,113
I know what happened. This is great.

114
00:06:57,113 --> 00:07:01,273
Ok, so here's the thing:

115
00:07:02,653 --> 00:07:04,081
What did I just do?

116
00:07:04,651 --> 00:07:07,145
Let's think of some functions in p5,

117
00:07:07,145 --> 00:07:10,404
I know I'm off on like this horrible
tangent for another 5 minutes ...

118
00:07:10,404 --> 00:07:16,341
Some functions in p5are like line(), 
rect() for drawing a rectangle,

119
00:07:16,341 --> 00:07:18,145
ellipse() for drawing an ellipse,

120
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:21,373
What if you wanna draw a point 
on the screen, huh?

121
00:07:21,373 --> 00:07:23,228
What's the name of that function again?

122
00:07:23,228 --> 00:07:25,032
point()!

123
00:07:25,032 --> 00:07:28,696
So point() is kind of like an important
thing in p5 that's meant

124
00:07:28,696 --> 00:07:33,324
for something highly specific:
drawing a point!

125
00:07:33,324 --> 00:07:35,936
So if I try to make up a variable

126
00:07:35,936 --> 00:07:38,132
called point ...

127
00:07:38,132 --> 00:07:43,437
I have completely overriden 
the existing point() function

128
00:07:43,437 --> 00:07:45,824
and you know what?
I didn't actually override it cause

129
00:07:45,824 --> 00:07:48,436
p5 then overrode my variable 
cause things are happening

130
00:07:48,436 --> 00:07:49,956
in a weird order and strange ways.

131
00:07:49,956 --> 00:07:54,956
So that didn't work, it was trying like
use the point() function as the place

132
00:07:54,956 --> 00:07:58,601
to draw the point and everything 
exploded and I got a weird error message.

133
00:07:58,601 --> 00:08:02,957
So that might be something that p5 
could handle with a friendlier message,

134
00:08:02,957 --> 00:08:06,260
and maybe after this video is over, 
someone will file a github issue,

135
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,521
maybe that person will be me.

136
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:12,291
But let's go back, and hopefully
you saw the steps of debugging

137
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:15,653
of like everything was exploding
and going wrong ... just keep calm,

138
00:08:15,653 --> 00:08:18,860
take a deep breath, 
calm down, comment some stuff out,

139
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:22,393
start putting it back into slowly,
seeing where things go wrong,

140
00:08:22,393 --> 00:08:23,923
we've gotten a bit further.

141
00:08:23,923 --> 00:08:26,456
But now we're back! I'm back.

142
00:08:26,456 --> 00:08:29,553
This video is still only at 8 minutes,
which is totally reasonable,

143
00:08:29,553 --> 00:08:34,552
and we're going to go back 
and change this to 'spot'

144
00:08:34,552 --> 00:08:37,861
I'm gonna say: spot.x , spot.y

145
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:41,185
and I'm gonna run it ...

146
00:08:41,185 --> 00:08:42,605
and we can see: there we go!

147
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:45,121
I have the circle ... and I'm gonna
move this over here ...

148
00:08:45,121 --> 00:08:47,299
being drawn

149
00:08:47,299 --> 00:08:52,236
Excuse me, I'm like, ...
I want this to give me a little more space.

150
00:08:52,236 --> 00:08:57,041
I have the circle being drawn
at 100, 50 where the spot is

151
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:58,465
with this particular color.

152
00:08:58,465 --> 00:09:01,613
So what happens if we start 
to add some randomness here?

153
00:09:01,613 --> 00:09:05,421
So one thing I could do ... 
first, remember: draw() is looping

154
00:09:05,421 --> 00:09:06,872
over and over again ...

155
00:09:06,872 --> 00:09:12,632
so what if I just say: 
spot.x = random(0,600); ?

156
00:09:12,632 --> 00:09:14,101
This is another thing worth mentioning:

157
00:09:14,101 --> 00:09:18,569
I have a random spot anywhere
between 0 and the width of that canvas,

158
00:09:18,569 --> 00:09:23,297
the width of that canvas is 600
so I could write the number 600 there.

159
00:09:23,297 --> 00:09:28,600
There does happen to be a built-in variable
in p5 that knows just dynamically

160
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,133
what the width of the window is

161
00:09:30,133 --> 00:09:33,621
and this is useful to use because 
if I use that variable 'width' here

162
00:09:33,621 --> 00:09:37,653
instead of typing '600', if I later
change the size in createCanvas()

163
00:09:37,653 --> 00:09:39,296
I don't have to change elsewhere in my code.

164
00:09:39,296 --> 00:09:40,589
So I am gonna do that.

165
00:09:40,589 --> 00:09:45,184
And I'm also gonna say:
spot.y = random(0, height);

166
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:48,284
So now let's run this program ...

167
00:09:48,284 --> 00:09:51,836
And look! I just get spots all over the place:
spots, spots, spots.

168
00:09:51,836 --> 00:09:53,532
All with a nice red color.

169
00:09:53,532 --> 00:10:02,185
But perhaps what I want is 
to say: col.r = random(100,255);

170
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:11,790
col.g = 0;
col.b = random(100,190);

171
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:14,077
I'm just picking random, arbitrary ranges here.

172
00:10:14,077 --> 00:10:17,294
And now we might see ... 
Look: I've got a nice variation

173
00:10:17,294 --> 00:10:19,501
of random purple-ish, pink-ish dots

174
00:10:19,501 --> 00:10:23,149
and I could even say: 
add a little bit of alpha here,

175
00:10:24,939 --> 00:10:26,181
and run this again ...

176
00:10:26,181 --> 00:10:30,813
and you can see I have 
a nice little pointillist, and you can actually,

177
00:10:30,813 --> 00:10:33,117
one thing you're noticing here,
if you look really closely,

178
00:10:33,117 --> 00:10:36,313
there's this little black outline 
because I didn't turn of the stroke.

179
00:10:36,313 --> 00:10:39,233
So what I am going to do now 
is say: noStroke();

180
00:10:39,233 --> 00:10:41,972
and stop and start ...

181
00:10:41,972 --> 00:10:45,972
and there ... just look at this 
beautiful, all these nice, little dots

182
00:10:45,972 --> 00:10:49,168
layering, nice, little pointillist thing ...

183
00:10:49,168 --> 00:10:51,025
So you can take this much further,

184
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:54,733
you can make random sizes, 
you can map the random ranges

185
00:10:54,733 --> 00:10:57,897
based on like where ...
like: if the dots appear on the left

186
00:10:57,897 --> 00:11:00,023
they're more greenish, if they're
on the right, they're more blue-ish,

187
00:11:00,023 --> 00:11:02,188
so there is so much you could do!

188
00:11:02,188 --> 00:11:07,909
Maybe try to create a random 
painting here, you could use other shapes

189
00:11:07,909 --> 00:11:11,721
besides just circles, that sort of thing
as an exercise you could try,

190
00:11:11,721 --> 00:11:16,592
You also might return to this particular 
program if you remember this,

191
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:18,993
we worked just on a little bit 
of a painting program

192
00:11:18,993 --> 00:11:21,698
where you move the mouse around

193
00:11:21,698 --> 00:11:24,989
and as you move the mouse around
you paint something,

194
00:11:24,989 --> 00:11:30,084
and so what if you could, every time
you click the mouse it erases the background,

195
00:11:30,084 --> 00:11:33,257
what if every time you click the mouse
you get a random background color?

196
00:11:33,257 --> 00:11:37,713
Or as you move the mouse 
the colors changes randomly?

197
00:11:37,713 --> 00:11:40,777
So there's a lot of
interesting possibilties there,

198
00:11:40,777 --> 00:11:43,309
you can make this painting program
a little more sophisticated.

199
00:11:43,309 --> 00:11:46,973
Ok, so that is the end of this video!

200
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:50,569
And I think this wraps up my section
of videos on variables

201
00:11:50,569 --> 00:11:54,705
and I'm gonna keep that weird
little thing that happened,

202
00:11:54,705 --> 00:11:57,221
that I think was a good moment
for today.

203
00:11:57,221 --> 00:11:59,721
Ok, see you later!
