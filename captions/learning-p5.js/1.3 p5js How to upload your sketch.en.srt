1
00:00:02,441 --> 00:00:05,731
Hi! So I am here and
I am making a video.

2
00:00:05,731 --> 00:00:07,909
And what I would like to try to do

3
00:00:07,909 --> 00:00:12,799
in this video is demonstrate
uploading a p5 sketch

4
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:15,763
from your laptop to a server

5
00:00:15,763 --> 00:00:18,705
so that other people can go
to their own web browsers,

6
00:00:18,726 --> 00:00:20,766
type in some URL, 
and see the marvellous,

7
00:00:20,766 --> 00:00:22,656
wonderful work that you have done!

8
00:00:23,331 --> 00:00:25,611
So, before I go to the computer 
and demonstrate steps

9
00:00:25,611 --> 00:00:27,436
what I would like to do is discuss

10
00:00:27,436 --> 00:00:29,771
all the different pieces at play here

11
00:00:29,771 --> 00:00:31,751
it is actually kind of a simple 
thing in a way,

12
00:00:31,751 --> 00:00:34,149
I'm probably overcomplacting it, 
but let's give this a try

13
00:00:34,149 --> 00:00:36,608
you could just shut this off,
or speed ahead like 5 minutes

14
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:40,011
if you just want to get to the guts here.

15
00:00:40,018 --> 00:00:41,833
Ok, So ... what's happening,

16
00:00:41,837 --> 00:00:48,137
you are working on a laptop
and you have the p5 IDE

17
00:00:48,138 --> 00:00:54,269
You are working in the P5 IDE, which 
if you zoom in on that,

18
00:00:54,269 --> 00:00:57,938
you are writing some code
and that code is JavaScript

19
00:00:57,938 --> 00:01:00,053
You are writing code in Javascript

20
00:01:00,053 --> 00:01:04,566
uh, there is a play button,
somewhere in that IDE

21
00:01:04,566 --> 00:01:10,755
and you hit play, when you hit play
you see another window opens up,

22
00:01:10,755 --> 00:01:16,319
that window is actually a browser window,
and you see the result of your code

23
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:18,868
whatever you've written in you code,
"draw circle", "draw rectangle",

24
00:01:18,868 --> 00:01:21,708
all that stuff, it's there in this browser.

25
00:01:21,708 --> 00:01:24,683
So all of this is just happening locally
on you laptop.

26
00:01:24,683 --> 00:01:30,018
Here is the thing that you might not
consider, or have thought of

27
00:01:30,018 --> 00:01:34,122
This.. in that step when you hit play,
what happens ?

28
00:01:34,122 --> 00:01:38,258
"Launch a server"

29
00:01:38,258 --> 00:01:41,709
There is actually a server that's running,
on your machine, your laptop

30
00:01:41,709 --> 00:01:43,907
(I don't know why I'm assuming
you are using a laptop

31
00:01:43,907 --> 00:01:46,587
... that's what I'm using these days, so, 
maybe you are too)

32
00:01:46,587 --> 00:01:51,192
That server is launch behind the scenes
which serves up your sketch

33
00:01:51,192 --> 00:01:54,229
and allows this browser window to see it.

34
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:58,816
And so, what we want to do is
we want to find another server,

35
00:01:58,816 --> 00:02:04,679
one that's not sitting in you laptop
ans that is actually out in the Internet

36
00:02:04,679 --> 00:02:08,704
( you know "the cloud"... 
I think I saw this in a video...

37
00:02:08,704 --> 00:02:11,890
there is no "clouds", underground
bunkers somewhere )

38
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:19,026
but a server somewhere, that other people
could connect to

39
00:02:19,026 --> 00:02:25,091
uh...lots of other laptops,
they could connect to through some URL

40
00:02:25,091 --> 00:02:28,788
and they could see you beautiful 
circles and squares

41
00:02:28,788 --> 00:02:30,586
on their screen !

42
00:02:30,586 --> 00:02:33,560
Because, you don't really... It's not
really realistic at this point

43
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,583
for your laptop, for this little server
to suddenly serve up to the world

44
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:39,116
and then everybody connect to you

45
00:02:39,116 --> 00:02:43,290
( also... you know, this is possible
but that's another story for another day)

46
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:48,034
So what you need to do is take
this code and put it on that server

47
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:50,836
and figure out what that URL is

48
00:02:51,236 --> 00:02:56,429
and then everyone else, will be able
to see you beautiful circles and squares

49
00:02:56,429 --> 00:02:59,853
that you spent so
much time thinking about

50
00:02:59,853 --> 00:03:01,919
where to put them ?
what colours they should be ?

51
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:04,778
and purple and blue, I don't know, 
colours of the rainbow

52
00:03:04,778 --> 00:03:07,730
it's a nice thing to think about!

53
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:08,978
Ahh, so !

54
00:03:08,978 --> 00:03:11,305
So this is the steps that we want to do.

55
00:03:11,305 --> 00:03:13,503
Now, here is another piece,

56
00:03:13,503 --> 00:03:17,136
you are writing, we said,
JavaScript code here

57
00:03:17,136 --> 00:03:20,478
so you think all we need to do is take my
JavaScript code

58
00:03:20,478 --> 00:03:22,077
and put that on the server

59
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:26,647
but what's happening in the P5 IDE is
in addition to the Javascript code

60
00:03:26,647 --> 00:03:30,287
which might be called, a file, like 
"sketch.js",

61
00:03:30,287 --> 00:03:32,846
that's where your code is sitting,

62
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:36,804
behind the scene
and in some other video

63
00:03:36,804 --> 00:03:39,253
( or somebody else will talk to you,
I don't know when

64
00:03:39,253 --> 00:03:41,791
but I am not going into this to much
right now )

65
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:47,422
and this moment, there is 
another file called "index.html"

66
00:03:47,422 --> 00:03:51,819
and when these requests are made
this is really the file,

67
00:03:51,819 --> 00:03:54,395
this is the core file, that gets sent back
from the server

68
00:03:54,395 --> 00:03:56,611
that gets loaded into the browser

69
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:59,336
and this file refers to
to you JavaScript code

70
00:03:59,336 --> 00:04:03,026
so, in turn, your JavaScript code 
is seen in the browser.

71
00:04:03,026 --> 00:04:06,117
But, so these are the 2 files,
and there's other files...

72
00:04:06,117 --> 00:04:09,343
later you might have, you know
images, and sound files

73
00:04:09,343 --> 00:04:12,632
and there is something called CSS, which
adds some styling and layout

74
00:04:12,632 --> 00:04:14,384
and different things,

75
00:04:14,384 --> 00:04:17,735
but ultimately, you need at least
these 2 files

76
00:04:17,735 --> 00:04:19,264
HHHhhhhhh ! !

77
00:04:19,264 --> 00:04:20,942
I forgot something...

78
00:04:20,942 --> 00:04:23,617
You need this 2 files and you
need to send them to the server.

79
00:04:23,617 --> 00:04:25,696
OK, what did I forget ?

80
00:04:25,696 --> 00:04:28,765
There is also going to be a folder
called "Lib"

81
00:04:28,765 --> 00:04:32,726
and that folder called "Lib"
is going to have other things in it

82
00:04:32,726 --> 00:04:34,493
like a file called "p5.js"

83
00:04:34,493 --> 00:04:36,728
that's the P5 library

84
00:04:36,728 --> 00:04:41,059
You know there is a longer story here of
"ok, well, you don't actually have to have

85
00:04:41,059 --> 00:04:43,112
the P5 library here, you could
refer to it somewhere else"

86
00:04:43,112 --> 00:04:47,658
but for the sake of today,
just so we can get through this video,

87
00:04:47,658 --> 00:04:50,046
the way that... and this is how
the IDE works

88
00:04:50,046 --> 00:04:52,375
so it makes the most sense 
to just look at it this way.

89
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,694
You project is your code,

90
00:04:55,694 --> 00:04:58,569
it's this html file which refers to your code

91
00:04:58,569 --> 00:05:02,727
and then, also, the P5 library which 
allows you to write all this functions

92
00:05:02,727 --> 00:05:04,802
like rect(), ellipse(), fill(), stroke()...

93
00:05:04,802 --> 00:05:06,455
that sort of thing in your code

94
00:05:06,455 --> 00:05:11,369
and also, by the way, the index.html file
that is going to refer to that file too

95
00:05:11,369 --> 00:05:14,258
so you got to get all these things
up onto the server.

96
00:05:14,258 --> 00:05:17,055
Then you got to know, you know, 
what's you URL ?

97
00:05:17,055 --> 00:05:20,197
Well, presumably, you have a host
you've registered for an account

98
00:05:20,197 --> 00:05:22,905
with some company and they have 
given you lots of information

99
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:26,345
and, you know, uhhh... what your URL is

100
00:05:26,345 --> 00:05:33,415
it's, you know, "blabla.com" and depending
on if you make this into a directory,

101
00:05:33,415 --> 00:05:35,135
then it's going to be /something/something

102
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:37,929
...well I guess when I show you 
on the computer

103
00:05:37,929 --> 00:05:39,221
( if you're still watching...)

104
00:05:39,221 --> 00:05:42,650
uhhh, this will become more... but ah !

105
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:45,320
How do you get this stuff to the server ?

106
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,119
There is lots of ways to do that.

107
00:05:47,119 --> 00:05:49,172
All sort of interesting strange ways,

108
00:05:49,172 --> 00:05:51,651
I have a personal favorite
I'm using this way called "GitHub pages"

109
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:53,750
but I'm not going to do that in this video

110
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,671
and I probably shouldn't have mentioned that

111
00:05:55,671 --> 00:05:58,826
(edit that out later ... except I'm not
going to edit that later... because I don't edit these)

112
00:05:58,826 --> 00:06:02,795
But , uhh, so , you need to do 
something called "FTP",

113
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:06,481
and this is where I'm very exited to say
that I actually, I think I know what

114
00:06:06,481 --> 00:06:09,057
that stands for:
"File Transfer Protocol".

115
00:06:09,057 --> 00:06:11,460
Because we want to transfer this files
and we need some protocols

116
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,433
for transferring this files

117
00:06:14,433 --> 00:06:17,152
and, in fact, most likely, 
what you actually need

118
00:06:17,152 --> 00:06:22,350
is "SFTP", it depends on, what kind of
hoster, server or whatever you have

119
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:27,150
"Secure ! File Transfer Protocol" because

120
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:30,322
you don't want anyone to hack in
and see

121
00:06:30,322 --> 00:06:34,356
your precious pink and purple, rainbow 
coloured shapes,

122
00:06:34,356 --> 00:06:37,301
that you are uploading to the server

123
00:06:37,305 --> 00:06:38,709
... hhhh, ok !

124
00:06:38,709 --> 00:06:41,575
Soooo, uhh, so this is the picture of it

125
00:06:41,575 --> 00:06:43,865
I went on to long about that
now let's...ah, by the way

126
00:06:43,865 --> 00:06:46,520
I haven't tried this yet

127
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,697
So, uh, so now we are going to go
over to the computer

128
00:06:50,597 --> 00:06:53,677
and actually walk through the steps
and look at how to do this

129
00:06:55,077 --> 00:06:56,737
(I'm gonna go over here now
and see if this works)

130
00:06:56,737 --> 00:06:57,730
Wooohaaaaa!!

131
00:06:58,272 --> 00:06:59,733
Ok, oh! My computer went to sleep!

132
00:06:59,733 --> 00:07:00,666
Come back!
Ah, there we go, ok !

133
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:03,352
So, what do you need now ?

134
00:07:03,352 --> 00:07:05,850
You need some software,
You need software

135
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:09,516
(hop ! there you are !
you ! I mean, you are a camera

136
00:07:09,516 --> 00:07:12,672
I guess you are a person, at some point
but...)

137
00:07:12,672 --> 00:07:15,116
You need some software

138
00:07:15,116 --> 00:07:18,059
the software that I am using is a 
(let me zoom in on this)

139
00:07:18,059 --> 00:07:20,052
called "Cyberduck".

140
00:07:20,052 --> 00:07:23,145
This is FTP software
it allows to FTP files but

141
00:07:23,145 --> 00:07:26,585
you know, Google "FTP software"
find your personal favourite

142
00:07:26,585 --> 00:07:28,843
ask you friends who love to FTP
on the week ends or whatever

143
00:07:28,843 --> 00:07:31,984
uuh, but, you might as well look 
at Cyberduck. It's free and uh ...

144
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:34,197
it works!

145
00:07:34,197 --> 00:07:37,712
So uh, now, but ok, so 
and I also have the p5 IDE

146
00:07:37,712 --> 00:07:40,093
if you don't know where to get the p5 IDE

147
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:44,759
you want to go the the p5 js website
that's p5js.org

148
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:50,566
and you want to go to "Download"
and then you want to scroll down

149
00:07:50,566 --> 00:07:52,820
and you want to download the editor

150
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,977
the Mac version OR...
the Windows version ! which is

151
00:07:55,977 --> 00:07:58,632
really exciting because, like a month ago
that didn't exist

152
00:07:58,632 --> 00:08:01,396
so, uuh, so I've already done that

153
00:08:01,396 --> 00:08:06,140
so I don't need to do that and
(hello ! ) so I'm just going to launch

154
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:09,980
Cyberduck, and you gonna see here
the thing that I need to do is

155
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:13,900
I would like to "Open a Connection" to my server

156
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,909
( Ahhhh! Oh I don't know I made that full screen
I don't want to do that

157
00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:22,770
view, ooohh, shit, get out of that
here we go)

158
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:28,212
uh, "Open a Connection" and
now there is some information here

159
00:08:28,212 --> 00:08:31,696
first thing I want to do is
I want to change this to SFTP

160
00:08:31,696 --> 00:08:35,518
and wouldn't it be nice if I knew
(oh... sorry) the server address -laugh-

161
00:08:35,518 --> 00:08:37,118
this is something you are going
to have to know !

162
00:08:37,118 --> 00:08:43,563
(I should, like, just pause this video, but I...
there is nothing I can you, I had this set before)

163
00:08:43,563 --> 00:08:54,119
"shiffman."... (oh shout) ..."imnyuad.com
(it, like, what's the chance that that's right)

164
00:08:54,119 --> 00:08:59,987
"dshiffman" and then my password
very secret (and I can't say what it is)

165
00:08:59,987 --> 00:09:05,875
(what's the chance that this works ?
Ah! Ah, I'm a genius ! Ok guys

166
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:08,752
I'm really lucky.)
So, I'm sorry about that, I still can

167
00:09:08,752 --> 00:09:10,989
remember that, that's cool.

168
00:09:10,989 --> 00:09:13,011
Ok, so, this is my URL.
This is a bit of a strange URL

169
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:23,976
most likely, you are going to have
something... (ramble)

170
00:09:25,626 --> 00:09:30,860
you most likely have something, like,
you know, uh...

171
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:33,674
funkyswesite.com
or whatever your URL is

172
00:09:33,674 --> 00:09:36,722
So your are not gonna have this strange
sub-domain thing

173
00:09:36,722 --> 00:09:39,111
but it's up to you
whatever you registered with your host

174
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:41,424
that's what your are going to do

175
00:09:41,424 --> 00:09:43,585
and then, your host is going
to have different settups

176
00:09:43,585 --> 00:09:46,219
there is, you know, 
a bunch of directories

177
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:48,442
uh, this is the directory of files

178
00:09:48,442 --> 00:09:51,270
that actually are publicly viewable
on the web

179
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:53,238
So your server is sitting there

180
00:09:53,238 --> 00:09:54,890
and you can have all sort of files
on this server

181
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:57,473
but there is usually a directory
sometimes it's called like

182
00:09:57,473 --> 00:10:00,511
"public_html" that usually
a directory that is specified

183
00:10:00,511 --> 00:10:02,999
so whatever you put in there
those are the files

184
00:10:02,999 --> 00:10:06,790
that you can actually see
by making these requests

185
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:11,004
( ok, so uh, am I back here ?, I am )

186
00:10:11,004 --> 00:10:14,529
So, ok, so we've logged in, that good
and we'll leave that over there

187
00:10:14,529 --> 00:10:17,112
I'm going to open up p5

188
00:10:17,112 --> 00:10:21,792
I'm going to make a sketch and then say
(oh boy ! I need to just think about

189
00:10:21,792 --> 00:10:23,272
making the font bigger ... )

190
00:10:23,272 --> 00:10:27,241
I'm going to say
"createCanvas(400, 300);"

191
00:10:27,241 --> 00:10:30,432
that's my favourite resolution ...
what's yours?

192
00:10:30,432 --> 00:10:35,142
I'm going to say
background(0);

193
00:10:35,142 --> 00:10:38,361
I'm going to say:
fill(0, 100, 255);

194
00:10:38,361 --> 00:10:43,604
I'm going to say:
ellipse(200,150, 100, 100);

195
00:10:43,604 --> 00:10:45,465
that's my favourite kind of ellipse

196
00:10:45,465 --> 00:10:47,549
I'm going to hit "save",
that's very important!

197
00:10:47,549 --> 00:10:50,039
I'm going to hit "save".
Now where do I save ?

198
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:53,085
Wherever I save this
that's where these files,

199
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:55,925
all these extra files are 
actually going to end up.

200
00:10:55,925 --> 00:10:58,698
So, I'm going to save it to the desktop

201
00:10:58,698 --> 00:11:02,997
I'm gonna say
I'm gonna call "shiffman_ week1"

202
00:11:02,997 --> 00:11:05,886
referring to my name and it's
week 1 of my semester

203
00:11:05,886 --> 00:11:08,300
(...)

204
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,204
I don't know if anyone is going
to watch this

205
00:11:10,204 --> 00:11:13,573
beside the people who are like...
required to

206
00:11:13,573 --> 00:11:16,370
(...)

207
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:18,949
but ok, so, I'm gonna hit "save"

208
00:11:18,949 --> 00:11:21,016
I didn't even test my code
I should test my code

209
00:11:21,016 --> 00:11:22,847
and then I hit "run"
and you can see that it works

210
00:11:22,847 --> 00:11:25,101
I have my beautiful circle, it's blue

211
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,663
hmm, I don't know it it's my favourite
colour, but it works for today

212
00:11:27,663 --> 00:11:30,586
uh, and now I'm gonna save it again

213
00:11:30,586 --> 00:11:33,583
and then I'm gonna... look !
look at this directory

214
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:35,274
right here

215
00:11:35,274 --> 00:11:37,067
This directory, if I look in
that directory

216
00:11:37,067 --> 00:11:39,365
(wow ! where did that go ?)

217
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,994
Hmm, now you can see

218
00:11:40,994 --> 00:11:42,658
I've got those files I'm talking about

219
00:11:42,658 --> 00:11:45,281
I've got "sketch.js" which is my code

220
00:11:45,281 --> 00:11:46,848
I've got "index.html" 
which is my html file

221
00:11:46,848 --> 00:11:49,653
you can look inside here
and see what's in there

222
00:11:49,653 --> 00:11:51,349
make changes to it
if you want to play around

223
00:11:51,349 --> 00:11:53,381
uh, and then you can see

224
00:11:53,381 --> 00:11:54,735
here are the libraries

225
00:11:54,735 --> 00:11:56,535
"p5.js" is the only one
I'm actually using

226
00:11:56,535 --> 00:11:57,912
but included are also

227
00:11:57,912 --> 00:12:00,442
"p5.sound.js" which allows 
you to play sounds

228
00:12:00,442 --> 00:12:02,272
and do all sorts of amazing sound stuff

229
00:12:02,272 --> 00:12:05,279
"p5.dom.js" ...
which allows you to do some

230
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,240
other interesting things
that have to do with the dom

231
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,065
but, you know, I got to stop this video at
some point.

232
00:12:10,065 --> 00:12:11,920
So , now, what I'm going to do

233
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,781
(and really, I should have just
started here)

234
00:12:13,781 --> 00:12:15,802
I'm going to take this whole folder

235
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:20,464
(uh, ok, uuuuh, "edit on the disk"
I don't know, may be if you want to

236
00:12:20,464 --> 00:12:22,475
ahh, something weird happened
I don't care)

237
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:24,072
I take this whole folder

238
00:12:24,072 --> 00:12:27,048
and I'm going to upload it

239
00:12:27,048 --> 00:12:28,795
uhh, and then I going to click "allow"

240
00:12:28,795 --> 00:12:32,415
and , if we look
we can see there

241
00:12:32,415 --> 00:12:34,523
that folder is in there "shiffman-week1"

242
00:12:34,523 --> 00:12:36,334
and there there is some other stuff

243
00:12:36,334 --> 00:12:38,672
from , like, some other stuff I did
at one point, a few month ago

244
00:12:38,672 --> 00:12:41,371
but now, if you think about it

245
00:12:41,371 --> 00:12:45,131
where is my URL ?

246
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:53,906
"shiffman.imnyuad.com" slash
"shiffman_week1"

247
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:56,863
Ok, let's try this

248
00:12:56,863 --> 00:13:06,580
(ok tatadaaa) I'm going to go to
"shiffman.imnyuad.com/shiffman_week1"

249
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:11,378
Woohoo !! That worked !
See, look!

250
00:13:11,378 --> 00:13:13,877
And now, all you have to do is,

251
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:18,756
I don't know, put this on your Twitter

252
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:21,044
or your Facebook, 
or e-mail it to your friends,

253
00:13:21,044 --> 00:13:25,395
honestly just go and update that
GitHub Wiki that is for class

254
00:13:25,395 --> 00:13:27,227
and link it to you homework

255
00:13:27,227 --> 00:13:30,415
So, uh, this is a thrilling day for me

256
00:13:30,415 --> 00:13:32,701
that I recorded this video and that there
is a circle here

257
00:13:32,701 --> 00:13:35,632
I doubt this is a all a thrilling day
for you

258
00:13:35,632 --> 00:13:38,291
but I will see you again, at some point

259
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:40,925
and another video! 
maybe, maybe not?

260
00:13:40,925 --> 00:13:42,715
Uh, I have to stop this now

261
00:13:42,715 --> 00:13:44,691
Oh, I don't have a mouse ...
I can't stop it, come on mouse

262
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:46,413
Ok, bye !!
