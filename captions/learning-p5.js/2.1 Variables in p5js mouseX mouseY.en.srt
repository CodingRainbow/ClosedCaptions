00:00:02,551 --> 00:00:06,047
Hello! Variables, p5js, Javascript!

2
00:00:06,047 --> 00:00:08,144
Haha, I'm just speaking in single words.

3
00:00:08,144 --> 00:00:11,548
Ok, this is a video where ... 
The topic I want to look at,

4
00:00:11,548 --> 00:00:12,645
it's probably going to be 
a couple of videos,

5
00:00:12,645 --> 00:00:15,069
is variables. But we gotta
ease our way into it.

6
00:00:15,069 --> 00:00:19,373
Before we even know what
a variable is, let's think about

7
00:00:19,373 --> 00:00:24,873
why ... what's missing from the programs
that you are writing?

8
00:00:24,873 --> 00:00:28,798
In the previous video I showed you
how to draw a static thing to the screen.

9
00:00:28,798 --> 00:00:31,264
You could make a rectangle, 
a circle, color it,

10
00:00:31,264 --> 00:00:33,860
and in order to do that, 
before you can do that,

11
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:40,849
we had to add two 'things',

12
00:00:40,849 --> 00:00:42,817
blocks of code I'll call them.

13
00:00:42,817 --> 00:00:46,993
A block of code is something 
that begins with an open curly bracket

14
00:00:46,993 --> 00:00:49,120
and ends with a close curly bracket.

15
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,911
A setup() block ...

16
00:00:53,911 --> 00:00:56,981
and a draw() block.

17
00:00:56,981 --> 00:00:59,544
Each of these blocks, by the way,

18
00:00:59,544 --> 00:01:01,608
is a function. 
Functions are these fundamental

19
00:01:01,608 --> 00:01:04,817
primary elements of just about how
everything works in Javascript.

20
00:01:04,817 --> 00:01:08,721
So it's gonna be a key topic
throughout all the videos that I make.

21
00:01:08,721 --> 00:01:16,077
And a function is essentially
a way of organizing a block of code,

22
00:01:16,077 --> 00:01:18,337
a bunch of lines of instructions
all together.

23
00:01:18,337 --> 00:01:21,480
There is a bunch of setup instructions,
there is a bunch of drawing instructions.

24
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:25,608
I said, whenever the last video was,

25
00:01:25,608 --> 00:01:28,141
that setup() is a place where
you put createCanvas().

26
00:01:28,141 --> 00:01:37,336
And createCanvas requires two arguments:
a width and a height.

27
00:01:37,336 --> 00:01:41,868
Then you get this nice rectangle on the screen.

28
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:43,723
A canvas for you to draw to.

29
00:01:43,723 --> 00:01:47,868
And when it's time to draw to that canvas
you add some instructions

30
00:01:47,868 --> 00:01:50,064
in the draw() function like

31
00:01:50,064 --> 00:01:52,054
background()

32
00:01:53,364 --> 00:01:56,857
background(0) will give 
you a black background,

33
00:01:58,607 --> 00:02:00,921
and then perhaps you might add 
something like:

34
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:08,421
ellipse(50,50,75,25), 
it's a weird looking ellipse,

35
00:02:08,421 --> 00:02:12,324
which would then draw, uh, 
it would more look like this,

36
00:02:12,324 --> 00:02:14,452
anyway, something like this, right?

37
00:02:14,452 --> 00:02:16,016
So this is what we've got so far:

38
00:02:16,016 --> 00:02:18,452
there's a setup() block, 
and a draw() block.

39
00:02:18,452 --> 00:02:20,181
Both of those things are functions.

40
00:02:21,731 --> 00:02:24,313
There is a bit more to it 
than just this idea of

41
00:02:24,313 --> 00:02:26,005
ah, createCanvas is in setup()

42
00:02:26,005 --> 00:02:27,910
and this stuff is in draw().
there's a reason why we're putting

43
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,813
some things in setup() 
and some things in draw().

44
00:02:29,813 --> 00:02:34,281
And it has to do with the flow
of a program. (I hope I'm recording)

45
00:02:34,281 --> 00:02:36,908
A flow of a program over time.

46
00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:40,941
If you've ever used any piece
of software, you know there's

47
00:02:40,941 --> 00:02:43,006
an element of time there:
you've launched the software,

48
00:02:43,006 --> 00:02:44,765
you do some stuff,
some more things happen,

49
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:45,865
you do some more stuff.

50
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:48,365
It doesn't just start 
drawing a picture and end.

51
00:02:48,365 --> 00:02:55,201
So a p5 sketch, a browser session
so to speak, happens over time.

52
00:02:55,201 --> 00:02:58,561
And these functions are controlling
that flow.

53
00:02:58,561 --> 00:03:00,363
How do they control that flow?

54
00:03:00,363 --> 00:03:03,993
setup() happens once, at the beginning.

55
00:03:03,993 --> 00:03:07,624
When the program runs, 
the first thing that happens

56
00:03:07,624 --> 00:03:09,093
is setup() and it happens once.

57
00:03:09,093 --> 00:03:11,801
Which makes sense: you don't
want to create a canvas more than once.

58
00:03:11,801 --> 00:03:13,283
At the beginning you create the canvas once.

59
00:03:13,283 --> 00:03:16,481
draw() however does something
kind of interesting:

60
00:03:16,481 --> 00:03:20,593
it runs the instructions, after setup() finishes

61
00:03:20,593 --> 00:03:22,188
these instructions get executed.

62
00:03:22,188 --> 00:03:25,544
And when it gets to the end, 
it goes right back to the beginning.

63
00:03:25,544 --> 00:03:28,157
background > ellipse > end, 
right back to background.

64
00:03:28,157 --> 00:03:29,853
background > ellipse > end, 
right back to background.

65
00:03:29,853 --> 00:03:33,689
This is now as a loop.
And it essentially happens forever.

66
00:03:34,469 --> 00:03:37,061
It happens forever until a user
closes the window.

67
00:03:37,061 --> 00:03:41,177
You know, there's obviously a lot more to this,
you could stop and start it,

68
00:03:41,177 --> 00:03:43,321
or have lots of other things happening,
but this is our basic

69
00:03:43,321 --> 00:03:46,209
beginning flow for the program:

70
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:48,772
setup() happens once,
draw() loops over and over again.

71
00:03:48,772 --> 00:03:52,873
I wonder how many times I have talked
about setup() and draw() in my life?

72
00:03:52,873 --> 00:03:57,532
Probably like 250 ...
but I enjoy just as much this time

73
00:03:57,532 --> 00:04:00,032
as any other time. By Gosh!

74
00:04:00,032 --> 00:04:03,241
Ok, let's go over and prove this point here.

75
00:04:03,241 --> 00:04:07,132
So here is a p5 sketch,
and you can see that it is exactly

76
00:04:07,132 --> 00:04:10,001
the same format that I looked at
at the board:

77
00:04:10,001 --> 00:04:12,601
there is a setup() function at the top,
with createCanvas(),

78
00:04:12,601 --> 00:04:13,792
and there are a bunch of drawing things.

79
00:04:13,792 --> 00:04:16,533
This is a nice example 
that Lauren McCarthy prepared,

80
00:04:16,533 --> 00:04:18,196
unknowingly, for me!

81
00:04:18,196 --> 00:04:21,500
And if I run it you can see,
I love these colors,

82
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,794
I love the pink circle,
and I love the blue square.

83
00:04:23,794 --> 00:04:26,665
Now it doesn't look like anything's
happening over time

84
00:04:26,665 --> 00:04:28,861
because it's just like a static picture.

85
00:04:28,861 --> 00:04:31,393
It's beautiful but it doesn't move!

86
00:04:31,393 --> 00:04:34,793
And maybe that's ok, 
maybe all we wanna do in life

87
00:04:34,793 --> 00:04:37,293
is static pictures ... but assuming
you wanna make things move

88
00:04:37,293 --> 00:04:41,780
... it's drawing the same thing
over and over again.

89
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,520
What do we need to do?

90
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,313
We need to vary what happens 
every time draw() executes.

91
00:04:48,313 --> 00:04:51,280
draw() executes once,
twice, third time,

92
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,216
fourth time, fifth time ...

93
00:04:53,216 --> 00:04:55,217
What if something different happened?

94
00:04:55,217 --> 00:04:58,121
What if the first time the circle
appears up there,

95
00:04:58,121 --> 00:04:59,844
then the second time it appears
down here,

96
00:04:59,844 --> 00:05:01,153
the third time it appears down here?

97
00:05:01,153 --> 00:05:03,153
You'll have the illusion
that it's moving down.

98
00:05:03,153 --> 00:05:07,381
Or, even better yet, what if
you could just say:

99
00:05:07,381 --> 00:05:10,269
every time through draw() 
draw the circle where the mouse is?

100
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:16,673
So I could do something like:
ellipse ... where the mouse is ...

101
00:05:16,673 --> 00:05:17,736
Right? That should be fine.

102
00:05:17,736 --> 00:05:19,477
I'm sure that's gonna work ...

103
00:05:19,477 --> 00:05:22,945
I'm being facetious, I guess, 
but now ... you can see

104
00:05:22,945 --> 00:05:24,140
that I have an error here.

105
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,041
So this is obviously like 
'expected parenthesis'.

106
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:27,833
This is obviously not correct syntax.

107
00:05:29,213 --> 00:05:35,321
p5, Javascript, ... cannot understand
your regular old English language speak thing.

108
00:05:35,321 --> 00:05:42,060
However, this is such a common problem,
that p5 has as a part of its library

109
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,225
a variable called mouseX.

110
00:05:45,225 --> 00:05:48,693
So I'm gonna put mouseX in here,

111
00:05:48,693 --> 00:05:52,580
you can see that it's a nice purple color, right?

112
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:58,453
Because the p5 editor recognized that 
as a built-in keyword, a variable,

113
00:05:58,453 --> 00:06:01,809
and what this means is 
mouseX is a word

114
00:06:01,809 --> 00:06:03,340
that stands for something.

115
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:07,213
'100' is a number that
stands for the number 100.

116
00:06:07,213 --> 00:06:08,921
And it can always only 
be the number 100.

117
00:06:08,921 --> 00:06:12,485
But mouseX is actually referring
to something stored

118
00:06:12,485 --> 00:06:14,453
in the computer's memory,
that changes based

119
00:06:14,453 --> 00:06:15,985
on how the user moves the mouse.

120
00:06:15,985 --> 00:06:18,341
So if I run this program again,

121
00:06:19,111 --> 00:06:22,372
we can see mouseX is 100,
maybe 200, maybe 300,

122
00:06:22,372 --> 00:06:25,632
so now we can see that no matter
what I do ...

123
00:06:25,632 --> 00:06:28,164
draw() is happening over and over again,

124
00:06:28,164 --> 00:06:30,601
and it's always drawing an ellipse
where the mouse is.

125
00:06:30,601 --> 00:06:34,809
Wow, this is really ... I mean, if you 
haven't done this before

126
00:06:34,809 --> 00:06:36,132
hopefully this is kind of interesting!

127
00:06:37,372 --> 00:06:39,860
Ok, so there's a couple more things,

128
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,037
another thing we can look at here
which is kind of amazing.

129
00:06:43,087 --> 00:06:46,632
Now, what happens then if I take
some other things

130
00:06:46,632 --> 00:06:47,601
and put them in setup()?

131
00:06:47,601 --> 00:06:48,941
Like this background() function.

132
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:50,392
I'm gonna put this in setup().

133
00:06:50,392 --> 00:06:54,684
Remember: 
setup() happens just once!

134
00:06:54,684 --> 00:06:57,829
draw() loops over and over again.

135
00:06:59,359 --> 00:07:01,830
I haven't rerun it yet.
This is what happened

136
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,685
when its background()
was in draw(), right?

137
00:07:03,685 --> 00:07:07,424
The background is always being filled,
and then the ellipse is drawn.

138
00:07:07,424 --> 00:07:09,681
Background is filled, then the ellipse is drawn.

139
00:07:09,681 --> 00:07:12,461
What happens if the background
is drawn only once in setup()?

140
00:07:12,461 --> 00:07:14,183
You know, think about that for a second!

141
00:07:17,903 --> 00:07:19,089
Now I'm gonna run this again.

142
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:24,460
Look at this!
Every single ellipse, from the history

143
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:27,684
of moving, every time I moved it,
is now visible.

144
00:07:27,684 --> 00:07:30,785
This is because we only drew
that yellow background once ,

145
00:07:30,785 --> 00:07:35,204
and everything is drawn sequentially,
so this illusion of something moving around

146
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:40,381
the screen only exists if you erase
the background each time

147
00:07:40,381 --> 00:07:41,672
through draw() before you draw
the next thing.

148
00:07:41,672 --> 00:07:43,140
So this is something that you can play with,

149
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:47,241
and in fact, this is a pretty quick
path, if I get rid of this rectangle,

150
00:07:47,241 --> 00:07:50,609
and I say like 'noStroke();'

151
00:07:50,609 --> 00:07:53,045
and I also add 'mouseY' here

152
00:07:53,045 --> 00:07:54,576
and I run this.

153
00:07:56,016 --> 00:07:57,981
Now you can see I've made a
painting program,

154
00:07:57,981 --> 00:08:01,013
which is pretty nice,
like, ah, maybe I give it

155
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:02,577
a little alpha,

156
00:08:02,577 --> 00:08:05,305
which is the 4th argument,

157
00:08:05,305 --> 00:08:08,660
maybe I make that a little bit smaller,

158
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,596
and I run it again.

159
00:08:10,596 --> 00:08:13,433
You can see here is a little program
that I can use to kind of paint

160
00:08:13,433 --> 00:08:14,628
something with my mouse.

161
00:08:14,628 --> 00:08:18,432
So this is actually a great 
stopping point for this video.

162
00:08:18,432 --> 00:08:22,500
I wanna look in the next video
at how you make your own variables.

163
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,596
Oh, actually, no, 
I have one more thing!

164
00:08:25,596 --> 00:08:33,137
[ramble]

165
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:36,105
So in this painting program there is
one more thing that I want to show you

166
00:08:36,105 --> 00:08:36,973
that I think is really, really key.

167
00:08:36,973 --> 00:08:41,398
Ok, so, let's go back 
to the board over here ...

168
00:08:42,428 --> 00:08:46,833
and we have setup(), 
that is a function that runs ONCE,

169
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:47,962
at the beginning.

170
00:08:47,962 --> 00:08:51,638
We have draw() that's a function
that happens over and over again.

171
00:08:51,638 --> 00:08:54,492
Let's add one more function.

172
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:57,865
And I don't have a lot of room
on the whiteboard

173
00:08:57,865 --> 00:09:01,157
so I'm just gonna erase draw()
for a second to put it here.

174
00:09:02,577 --> 00:09:06,365
And I'm gonna say: what if I have ... 
pretend draw() is still there,

175
00:09:08,725 --> 00:09:12,044
and has a background and an ellipse,

176
00:09:12,044 --> 00:09:14,221
I'm gonna add another function

177
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:21,321
and I'm going to call it
mousePressed() { }

178
00:09:21,321 --> 00:09:26,241
So I have now complicated 
the flow of the program even more,

179
00:09:26,241 --> 00:09:27,741
in an interesting way.

180
00:09:27,741 --> 00:09:31,678
setup() happens once,
and only once at the beginning,

181
00:09:31,678 --> 00:09:37,821
draw() loops over and over again,
it's just draws like a crazy person!

182
00:09:37,821 --> 00:09:42,134
[ramble]

183
00:09:42,134 --> 00:09:47,581
mousePressed() is a very patient person,
quietly sitting aside,

184
00:09:47,581 --> 00:09:50,436
just waiting and waiting,
in fact mousePressed() might

185
00:09:50,436 --> 00:09:51,501
never ever happen!

186
00:09:51,501 --> 00:09:54,741
The program could run and
the code there will never occur.

187
00:09:54,741 --> 00:09:57,373
So this is what's known,
and this is also a key concept

188
00:09:57,373 --> 00:09:59,324
in Javascript, there's gonna be 
so much more to this,

189
00:09:59,324 --> 00:10:01,064
as an event!

190
00:10:01,064 --> 00:10:03,792
When the user clicks the mouse

191
00:10:03,792 --> 00:10:07,164
the code here is executed.

192
00:10:07,164 --> 00:10:10,229
So draw is just drawing and drawing
and drawing etc, the user clicks the mouse,

193
00:10:10,229 --> 00:10:12,601
we take a break from draw()
for a second,

194
00:10:12,601 --> 00:10:14,457
we run the code in mousePressed();

195
00:10:14,457 --> 00:10:16,393
and then draw() loops, loops, loops.

196
00:10:16,393 --> 00:10:18,601
The computer is doing this, the browser

197
00:10:18,601 --> 00:10:20,101
is executing all of these instructions.

198
00:10:20,101 --> 00:10:22,989
So now you have a bit 
more sophistication here:

199
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:26,601
you have setup(), you have draw(),
and you can always interrupt

200
00:10:26,601 --> 00:10:28,020
draw() with mousePressed().

201
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,217
So let's go back to our program

202
00:10:30,217 --> 00:10:32,424
I'm like: do you have any questions?

203
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:34,551
But there's no way for you to talk to me!

204
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:36,489
And I want you to talk to me somehow!

205
00:10:36,489 --> 00:10:41,425
So now over here, what I'm gonna
do to this program

206
00:10:41,425 --> 00:10:50,008
is I'm gonna add
function mousePressed() { }

207
00:10:50,008 --> 00:10:51,807
And what should we put 
in mousePressed()?

208
00:10:51,807 --> 00:10:54,976
How about we take this 
background function

209
00:10:54,976 --> 00:10:58,121
and we duplicate it in mousePressed()?

210
00:10:58,121 --> 00:11:03,247
So you can see when the program
first starts we make the canvas,

211
00:11:03,247 --> 00:11:04,264
we draw the background.

212
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:06,605
Then, always continuously, 
we just draw circles

213
00:11:06,605 --> 00:11:08,864
wherever the mouse is,
to let the user paint.

214
00:11:08,864 --> 00:11:10,736
And then what can the user do?

215
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:12,704
Now there's a new feature here!

216
00:11:12,704 --> 00:11:14,105
The user is moving the mouse ...

217
00:11:14,105 --> 00:11:16,509
moving the mouse ...
moving the mouse ...

218
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:20,561
and the user might say:
Ha, the drawing is not so good.

219
00:11:20,561 --> 00:11:21,864
I wanna erase it!

220
00:11:21,864 --> 00:11:24,367
Clicking the mouse will then
execute background()

221
00:11:24,367 --> 00:11:25,191
and it's gone!

222
00:11:25,191 --> 00:11:27,965
And now I could then try
to draw a D,

223
00:11:27,965 --> 00:11:30,772
and do something where I 
try to draw an A,

224
00:11:30,772 --> 00:11:32,068
and I'm like trying to 
make my name ...

225
00:11:32,068 --> 00:11:33,400
I don't know why I'm doing this ...

226
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,952
So this is pretty interesting:
you've got some tools now,

227
00:11:35,952 --> 00:11:40,223
you're missing a lot of things 
but with color, a bit more ...

228
00:11:40,223 --> 00:11:42,484
Uh, what I would say now,
as an exercise is:

229
00:11:42,484 --> 00:11:45,260
use setup(), use draw(),
use mousePressed()

230
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,856
you can draw more than just a circle!

231
00:11:46,856 --> 00:11:49,713
See what kind of painting program
you can make that allows

232
00:11:49,713 --> 00:11:53,212
the user to interactively 
create a drawing on the screen.

233
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,104
That's a nice constraint for an assignment.

234
00:11:55,104 --> 00:11:58,072
And in the next video
what I will show is how to create

235
00:11:58,072 --> 00:12:01,961
your own variables, 
beyond just what p5 offers to you,

236
00:12:01,961 --> 00:12:04,072
like where the mouse is, 
so you can have something

237
00:12:04,072 --> 00:12:06,023
move autonomously on the screen.

238
00:12:06,023 --> 00:12:08,540
And I'm gonna make that video right now!

239
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:13,251
By Golly! No, it's like after this
very long day of fighting with technology

240
00:12:13,251 --> 00:12:15,523
that is nothing that you need to 
worry yourself about,

241
00:12:15,523 --> 00:12:17,060
is kind of the last thing I wanna do.

242
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:17,688
But I'm gonna do it!

243
00:12:18,908 --> 00:12:20,862
Ok, I have to hit stop.
