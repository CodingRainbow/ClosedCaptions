00:00:02,637 --> 00:00:05,738
Hello! I'm making a video!

2
00:00:05,738 --> 00:00:08,412
You are watching a video, I think ...

3
00:00:08,412 --> 00:00:16,220
The goal of this video is to
talk about something called p5.js

4
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:19,163
What is p5.js?

5
00:00:19,163 --> 00:00:23,991
Who should you or might
you be thinking about learning

6
00:00:23,991 --> 00:00:28,000
this thing called p5.js
from the very, very beginner stage

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,638
without any experience with
anything else whatsoever

8
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:36,400
and what might you use it for 
and what's going to happen?

9
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,006
Am I making more videos? 
less videos? That sort of thing.

10
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:44,252
So, first let me give you 
a little context.

11
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:47,275
There is this thing called Processing.

12
00:00:49,344 --> 00:00:53,115
Processing is a project 
that started in 2001

13
00:00:53,115 --> 00:01:03,735
by Casey Reas and Benjamin Fry

14
00:01:03,735 --> 00:01:06,968
The two of them were students together
at the MIT media lab -

15
00:01:06,968 --> 00:01:12,294
designers, artists, programmers -
trying to make a tool

16
00:01:12,294 --> 00:01:14,508
that could help them 
with their own work.

17
00:01:14,508 --> 00:01:20,582
Since then, since 2001, this idea of
'creative coding' - it's a complex term,

18
00:01:20,582 --> 00:01:22,999
but - 'creative applications
through programming'

19
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:25,418
I like to think of it as 'creative 
expression through programming' -

20
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,364
how do you communicate and 
express your ideas

21
00:01:27,364 --> 00:01:31,628
while making computational tools -

22
00:01:31,628 --> 00:01:35,008
It's also like - if you know how to
learn to program -

23
00:01:35,008 --> 00:01:37,436
There's a lot of like, "Learn to program! 
Learn to program! Everyone's gotta

24
00:01:37,436 --> 00:01:39,568
learn to program! Aah!" kind of stuff
going on these days -

25
00:01:39,568 --> 00:01:44,740
Take a deep breath, relax, you don't need
to know how to program.

26
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,783
There's lots of great stuff 
in the world -

27
00:01:46,783 --> 00:01:48,613
you could learn how to play the violin, 
that's a wonderful thing,

28
00:01:49,203 --> 00:01:54,078
but there is an aspect of learning to
program that is very powerful in that

29
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:56,531
that software is something that 
drives so much of what we use.

30
00:01:56,531 --> 00:02:01,638
And if you want to not be stuck
just, kind of using whatever software

31
00:02:01,638 --> 00:02:04,205
other people - large corporations -

32
00:02:04,205 --> 00:02:06,968
if you want to be able to express yourself
in new and different ways,

33
00:02:06,968 --> 00:02:09,469
learning to program is a great 
way to do that.

34
00:02:09,469 --> 00:02:13,898
Also, and this is gonna kind of 
come around full circle here,

35
00:02:13,898 --> 00:02:19,814
learning to program and have the results
of what you program go in a browser

36
00:02:19,814 --> 00:02:23,753
on the web, so that other people can
see those things -

37
00:02:23,753 --> 00:02:29,288
that you can share and distribute 
easily - this is a very powerful thing.

38
00:02:29,288 --> 00:02:35,493
So, interestingly enough, when Processing
was first created, it was built on top of

39
00:02:35,505 --> 00:02:40,075
a programming language called 'Java', 
which was all the rage back in 2001

40
00:02:40,075 --> 00:02:47,343
and one of the reasons why Processing
used Java is that

41
00:02:47,343 --> 00:02:52,744
you can make these things called applets
and applets would run in the web browser!

42
00:02:52,744 --> 00:02:55,303
So you could program your thing 
in Processing, upload it to the web,

43
00:02:55,303 --> 00:02:59,360
distribute it, all the world would see it,
you'd become rich and famous

44
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,239
or, even better, you don't become 
rich and famous

45
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:05,004
but you do something good for the world
- or both, perhaps!

46
00:03:05,004 --> 00:03:08,076
then, that made a lot of sense.

47
00:03:08,076 --> 00:03:11,912
Fast-forward 14 years later, 2015,

48
00:03:11,912 --> 00:03:15,751
when was the last time you saw 
a java applet on the web?

49
00:03:15,751 --> 00:03:19,201
If you saw it, it was just basically an 
experience with a giant error message

50
00:03:19,201 --> 00:03:21,412
that told that your browser crashed
and nothing worked.

51
00:03:21,412 --> 00:03:27,299
The language these days of the browser
is something called JavaScript.

52
00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:28,843
And I'll say a bit more about that 
in a minute

53
00:03:28,843 --> 00:03:33,493
JavaScript allows you to program and 
create all sorts of exciting things

54
00:03:33,493 --> 00:03:36,943
that happen in a web browser.
If you're interested in creating unique

55
00:03:36,943 --> 00:03:43,193
and animated and creative web content,
learning JavaScript, learning p5.js, is

56
00:03:43,193 --> 00:03:44,463
something you might be interested in.

57
00:03:44,463 --> 00:03:57,691
Now, [...] some time in the last couple
of years, a bunch of us were talking

58
00:03:57,691 --> 00:03:59,615
and we asked the question:

59
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:05,663
"What language would you pick if 
Processing were being invented today?"

60
00:04:05,663 --> 00:04:11,705
And somebody that answered that question
in an interesting way,

61
00:04:11,705 --> 00:04:14,226
her name is Lauren McCarthy.

62
00:04:14,226 --> 00:04:20,904
So, Lauren McCarthy began a project, 
in collaboration with the Processing f...

63
00:04:20,904 --> 00:04:25,832
Processing is a not for profit foundation,
so I was about to say Processing foundation -

64
00:04:25,847 --> 00:04:32,577
[...ramble...]

65
00:04:32,577 --> 00:04:37,380
So Lauren said, "Ok, well, what if 
Processing was being invented today

66
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:43,379
and the language, instead of Java, 
was JavaScript?"

67
00:04:43,379 --> 00:04:46,952
So this is what p5.js is, as a project.

68
00:04:46,952 --> 00:04:50,390
I should just briefly mention, there's 
another wonderful project

69
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:54,440
called processing.js.

70
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,656
I know this is crazily confusing, I just
want to briefly mention it.

71
00:04:57,656 --> 00:05:01,199
processing.js is a project started by
John Resig and many other people

72
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,508
have worked on it since then.

73
00:05:02,508 --> 00:05:07,750
processing.js sort of tries to solve this
other problem:

74
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,899
your java code can't run on the web 
as an applet anymore,

75
00:05:10,899 --> 00:05:16,041
what if we could behind-the-scenes
translate it to JavaScript

76
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:17,690
so that it ran there?

77
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:23,670
But this project, p5.js, is different 
in that it is a new project.

78
00:05:23,676 --> 00:05:28,289
We can now think wonderfully and
happily about

79
00:05:28,289 --> 00:05:30,746
that thing called Processing 
that I briefly spoke about,

80
00:05:30,746 --> 00:05:33,569
but mostly right now, 
for the purpose of these videos,

81
00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:35,363
we can now ignore this.

82
00:05:35,363 --> 00:05:41,235
p5.js is an environment, a simple -
hopefully simple -

83
00:05:41,235 --> 00:05:43,050
and beginner-friendly environment

84
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,057
to help you learn JavaScript,

85
00:05:45,057 --> 00:05:48,787
to make applications, computational,
creative, interesting -

86
00:05:48,787 --> 00:05:52,583
hopefully interesting-
things happen in the browser.

87
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:55,269
And eventually, you could go in a lot of
routes with this.

88
00:05:55,269 --> 00:05:57,510
You might make art, 
you might make data visualization,

89
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:00,718
you might make websites, as like 
a web designer,

90
00:06:00,718 --> 00:06:03,623
there's lots of paths that you might take

91
00:06:03,623 --> 00:06:07,655
from this basic set of videos 
that I hope to make.

92
00:06:07,655 --> 00:06:15,136
I think that's just about the 
full context.

93
00:06:15,136 --> 00:06:17,075
There's some other pieces to

94
00:06:17,075 --> 00:06:19,437
"how do you make something happen
in the web browser",

95
00:06:19,437 --> 00:06:22,242
you need more than JavaScript, you need
these other things called

96
00:06:22,242 --> 00:06:25,030
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,

97
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,802
but I think what I wanna do now, 
very briefly,

98
00:06:26,802 --> 00:06:29,300
and I'm gonna pick this up in the
next video,

99
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,928
is just look at, open p5.js and
do a few things with it,

100
00:06:32,928 --> 00:06:36,002
just so you get a sense of what kinds of
things it can do.

101
00:06:36,002 --> 00:06:38,828
What would be great is if I had a video
that showed you like

102
00:06:38,828 --> 00:06:42,287
"Here are a bunch of awesome projects
that are made with these kinds of tools."

103
00:06:42,287 --> 00:06:47,005
Don't get me wrong, there's a lot of 
really amazing JavaScript framework.

104
00:06:47,005 --> 00:06:48,978
So I think a missing piece here --

105
00:06:48,978 --> 00:06:52,698
Just like Processing was built 
on top of Java,

106
00:06:52,698 --> 00:06:54,130
it's a little bit different here

107
00:06:54,130 --> 00:07:00,142
p5.js is not really built on top of 
JavaScript, it is a set of...

108
00:07:00,142 --> 00:07:05,225
boy, this is a hard one ...
and I was doing so well! [...]

109
00:07:08,865 --> 00:07:15,920
What I think is useful to think of here
for a moment is p5.js is two things:

110
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,667
One of these things is it's 
a library of functions.

111
00:07:18,667 --> 00:07:20,602
So, here's a great way 
of thinking about it.

112
00:07:20,602 --> 00:07:23,935
Let's say you want to learn JavaScript.
And you go to Google and you type,

113
00:07:23,935 --> 00:07:27,797
"JavaScipt" - boom.
Whoa! There's a lot of stuff out there.

114
00:07:27,797 --> 00:07:31,048
There's like a million Stack Overflow 
posts, which is like

115
00:07:31,048 --> 00:07:32,306
a place where people ask questions,

116
00:07:32,306 --> 00:07:35,798
there's 15 million "this.js" things
you could learn

117
00:07:35,798 --> 00:07:38,075
and there's something called jQuery
and there's so much.

118
00:07:38,075 --> 00:07:43,825
So, one of the goals, I think, of p5.js
is to give you a little bit of a sandbox,

119
00:07:43,825 --> 00:07:46,325
a walled garden, to learn 
some of the basics, and for that,

120
00:07:46,325 --> 00:07:48,029
you get a library of functions,

121
00:07:48,029 --> 00:07:50,599
to draw a circle, or draw a rectangle,
or set a color

122
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:53,973
so you can just use some basic drawing
functions to learn some of these

123
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,140
beginner steps of programming.

124
00:07:56,140 --> 00:08:00,751
The other thing it is, and I think I need 
to move over to the computer here,

125
00:08:08,411 --> 00:08:11,495
The other thing it is is this thing here

126
00:08:11,495 --> 00:08:18,604
Sam Lavigne has created something called
the p5.js editor

127
00:08:18,604 --> 00:08:21,847
What this means is an application, 
a program on your computer that

128
00:08:21,847 --> 00:08:26,456
you can launch and just start typing 
some code in and get your feet wet

129
00:08:26,456 --> 00:08:29,635
and start to experiment and learn a bit
about code, without having to worry about

130
00:08:30,695 --> 00:08:35,300
all of the larger pieces of things that 
you need in order to make something happen

131
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,087
on a web page. We're gonna do it very
simply here.

132
00:08:37,087 --> 00:08:39,653
So let's look at that for a second.
So I'm going to launch this.

133
00:08:39,653 --> 00:08:43,637
By the way, I just downloaded it.
I haven't -- I've used it...

134
00:08:45,797 --> 00:08:50,463
but, I haven't on this computer. 
So, look:

135
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:55,025
"p5 is an application downloaded from the
internet. Are you sure you want to open it?"

136
00:08:55,025 --> 00:08:58,687
So now's the time when you could say, 
"Eh, I'm just going to play the violin."

137
00:08:58,687 --> 00:09:04,358
Or, "I'm going to go play frisbee
- football - soccer."

138
00:09:04,358 --> 00:09:09,759
But I'm going to open it. 
[...]

139
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:12,395
A newer version of p5 is available.
I don't want to download it right now -

140
00:09:12,395 --> 00:09:17,037
just hit ok. Oops, I do want to download
it right now. Ok.

141
00:09:17,037 --> 00:09:35,368
So this here ...
[getting things opened]

142
00:09:35,368 --> 00:09:40,808
this here is the 
p5.js editor.

143
00:09:40,808 --> 00:09:45,444
And if you look at it, it's already 
filled in a little bit of code for you.

144
00:09:45,444 --> 00:09:48,093
So you can start to see, "Ah, I have to 
learn to program, I have to learn

145
00:09:48,093 --> 00:09:50,907
some strange new language and syntax."

146
00:09:50,907 --> 00:09:55,626
function. draw. parentheses. 
curly bracket. curly bracket.

147
00:09:55,626 --> 00:10:00,409
These are some things that will come
to light if you're for the first time

148
00:10:00,409 --> 00:10:02,568
watching this video and looking 
at programming.

149
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:06,835
So I'm gonna do a couple things here
real quick.

150
00:10:06,835 --> 00:10:13,769
One thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna type
in CreateCanvas and down here under draw

151
00:10:13,769 --> 00:10:19,707
I'm gonna type rectangle and I'm gonna
type some other numbers

152
00:10:19,707 --> 00:10:25,657
and I'm going to zoom back out 
and hit play.

153
00:10:25,657 --> 00:10:27,986
And we can see here,

154
00:10:27,986 --> 00:10:32,548
look what's happened.

155
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:36,399
I wrote something that says, 
"createCanvas!"

156
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,395
and what did that do? It made a canvas.

157
00:10:38,395 --> 00:10:40,204
That's the canvas.

158
00:10:40,204 --> 00:10:44,764
Then, down here, I wrote something that 
said rect, short for rectangle.

159
00:10:44,764 --> 00:10:47,057
What did it do? It made a rectangle.

160
00:10:47,057 --> 00:10:51,485
So these are the first pieces, the first
things, that I'm going to show you

161
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:52,868
in the next video.

162
00:10:52,868 --> 00:10:57,168
What lines of code do you start to write,
and what do those lines of code do?

163
00:10:57,168 --> 00:11:02,368
With ps.js here, the first things we're gonna 
learn is how to, like, draw a picture.

164
00:11:02,368 --> 00:11:07,038
And, by the way, this canvas is actually a
little mini web browser that's opened.

165
00:11:07,038 --> 00:11:11,969
So as more and more videos come to pass,
we can peel back some of these layers

166
00:11:11,969 --> 00:11:14,667
and see how you might take this and
put it on the web somewhere,

167
00:11:14,667 --> 00:11:17,463
share it, allow people to interact 
with it, that sort of thing.

168
00:11:17,463 --> 00:11:20,891
So, this video's ok. B+.

169
00:11:20,891 --> 00:11:25,304
I think I'm going to keep it though
and upload it and

170
00:11:25,304 --> 00:11:27,637
someday there will be a better one...
probably never...

171
00:11:27,637 --> 00:11:33,247
This is the end. I'm gonna make another
video and then upload that too

172
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:35,657
and you can watch many of them.

173
00:11:35,657 --> 00:11:38,835
And I'm keeping a list - maybe I'll try to
put a link in the description or something

174
00:11:38,835 --> 00:11:40,551
maybe a list of all the videos I'm going
to make.

175
00:11:40,551 --> 00:11:46,437
I'm gonna make a lot of intro ones and
then some project-based ones like

176
00:11:46,437 --> 00:11:50,888
how to take a Google Spreadsheet and 
visualize it as a graph in JavaScript and

177
00:11:50,888 --> 00:11:53,815
try to do that in a short 10 minutes.

178
00:11:53,815 --> 00:11:55,731
That's sort of my plan for this semester.
